# Tutorial: Design a relational database in Azure SQL Database using Azure Data Studio (ADS)

[!INCLUDE [appliesto-sqldb](../includes/appliesto-sqldb.md)]

Azure SQL Database is a relational database-as-a-service (DBaaS) in the Microsoft Cloud (Azure). In this tutorial, you learn how to use the Azure portal and [Azure Data Studio](/azure-data-studio/what-is-azure-data-studio) (ADS) to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Connect to the database with Azure Data Studio
> - Create tables with Azure Data Studio
> - Bulk load data with BCP
> - Query data with Azure Data Studio

> [!NOTE]
> For the purpose of this tutorial, we are using Azure SQL Database. You could also use a pooled database in an elastic pool or a SQL Managed Instance. For connectivity to a SQL Managed Instance, see these SQL Managed Instance quickstarts: [Quickstart: Configure Azure VM to connect to an Azure SQL Managed Instance](../managed-instance/connect-vm-instance-configure.md) and [Quickstart: Configure a point-to-site connection to an Azure SQL Managed Instance from on-premises](../managed-instance/point-to-site-p2s-configure.md).

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, make sure you've installed:

- [Azure Data Studio](/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio) (latest version)
- [BCP and SQLCMD](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=36433) (latest version).
- If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
- If you don't already have an Azure SQL Database created, visit [Quickstart: Create a single database](single-database-create-quickstart.md). Look for the option to use your offer to [try Azure SQL Database for free (preview)](free-offer.md).

## Sign in to the Azure portal

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

## Create a server-level IP firewall rule

Azure SQL Database creates an IP firewall at the server-level. This firewall prevents external applications and tools from connecting to the server and any databases on the server unless a firewall rule allows their IP through the firewall. To enable external connectivity to your database, you must first add an IP firewall rule for your IP address (or IP address range). Follow these steps to create a [server-level IP firewall rule](firewall-configure.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure SQL Database communicates over port 1433. If you are trying to connect to this service from within a corporate network, outbound traffic over port 1433 might not be allowed by your network's firewall. If so, you cannot connect to your database unless your administrator opens port 1433.

1. After the deployment completes, select **SQL databases** from the Azure portal menu or search for and select *SQL databases* from any page.  

1. Select *yourDatabase* on the **SQL databases** page. The overview page for your database opens, showing you the fully qualified **Server name** (such as `contosodatabaseserver01.database.windows.net`) and provides options for further configuration.

   :::image type="content" source="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\server-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal, database overview page with the server name highlighted." lightbox="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\server-name.png":::

1. Copy this fully qualified server name for use to connect to your server and databases from SQL Server Management Studio.

1. Select **Networking** under **Settings**. Choose the **Public Access** tab, and then select **Selected networks** under **Public network access** to display the **Firewall rules** section. 

   :::image type="content" source="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\server-firewall-rule.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal, networking page, showing where to set the server-level IP firewall rule." lightbox="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\server-firewall-rule.png":::

1. Select **Add your client IPv4** on the toolbar to add your current IP address to a new IP firewall rule. An IP firewall rule can open port 1433 for a single IP address or a range of IP addresses.

1. Select **Save**. A server-level IP firewall rule is created for your current IP address opening port 1433 on the server.

1. Select **OK** and then close the **Firewall settings** page.

Your IP address can now pass through the IP firewall. You can now connect to your database using SQL Server Management Studio or another tool of your choice. Be sure to use the server admin account you created previously.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, access through the SQL Database IP firewall is enabled for all Azure services. Select **OFF** on this page to disable for all Azure services.

## Connect to the database

Use [Azure Data Studio](/azure-data-studio/what-is-azure-data-studio) to establish a connection to your database.

1. Open Azure Data Studio.
1. In the **New Connection** from the Object Explorer to create a new connection and enter the following information. Leave other options as default.

   | Setting       | Suggested value | Description |
   | --------------|-----------------|------------ |
   | **Connection type** | Microsoft SQL Server | This value is required. |
   | **Server name** | The fully qualified Azure SQL Database logical server name | For example, `your_logical_azure_sql_server.database.windows.net`. |
   | **Authentication typoe** | SQL Server Authentication | Use SQL Server Authentication to enter a user name and password. |
   | | Microsoft Entra authentication | To connect using Microsoft Entra ID, if you're the Microsoft Entra server admin, choose **Microsoft Entra ID - Universal with MFA support**. For more information, see [Configure and manage Microsoft Entra authentication with Azure SQL](authentication-aad-configure.md).|
   | **Login** | The server admin account | The account that you specified when you created the server. |
   | **Password** | The password for your server admin account | The password that you specified when you created the server. |

   :::image type="content" source="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\connect-with-azure-data-studio.png" alt-text="Screenshot of connection dialog box in ADS.":::

1. Select **Connect**. The **Object Explorer** window opens in ADS.

1. In **Object Explorer**, expand **Databases** and then expand *yourDatabase* to view the objects in the sample database.  

1. In **Object Explorer**, right-click *yourDatabase* and select **New Query**. A blank query window opens that is connected to your database.

## Create tables in your database

Create a database schema with four tables that model a student management system for universities using [the Table Designer in Azure Data Studio](/azure-data-studio/overview-of-the-table-designer-in-azure-data-studio):

- `Person`
- `Course`
- `Student`
- `Credit`

The following diagram shows how these tables are related to each other. Some of these tables reference columns in other tables. For example, the `Student` table references the `PersonId` column of the `Person` table. Study the diagram to understand how the tables in this tutorial are related to one another. For an in-depth look at how to create effective normalized database tables, see [Designing a Normalized Database](/previous-versions/tn-archive/cc505842(v=technet.10)). For information about choosing data types, see [Data types](/sql/t-sql/data-types/data-types-transact-sql?view=azuresqldb-current&preserve-view=true). By default, tables are created in the default `dbo` schema, meaning the two-part name of a table will be `dbo.Person`, for example.

:::image type="content" source="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\tutorial-database-tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Table relationships.":::

1. In **Object Explorer**, Select *yourDatabase* which expands the dropdown menu of all processes stored in this database, right-click the **Tables** folder, select **New Table**. A blank Table Designer opens that is connected to your database.

1. Use the Table Designer interface to create these four tables in your database. To learn more about creating tables using the Table Designer, refer to [the Table Designer documentation](/azure-data-studio/overview-of-the-table-designer-in-azure-data-studio) :

    - Person Table

       Be sure to configure the Primary Key settings for the **Person** Table as shown below:

        :::image type="content" source="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\person-table-primary-key-azure-data-studio.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Person table in Table Designer showing the Primary Key settings." lightbox="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\person-table-primary-key-azure-data-studio.png":::

   - Student Table

        :::image type="content" source="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\student-table-azure-data-studio.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Student table in Table Designer." lightbox="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\student-table-azure-data-studio.png":::

       Be sure to configure the Primary Key settings for the **Student** Table as shown below:
           :::image type="content" source="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\student-table-primary-key-azure-data-studio.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Student table in Table Designer showing Primary Key settings." lightbox="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\student-table-primary-key-azure-data-studio.png":::

       Be sure to configure the Foreign Key settings for the **Student** Table as shown below:
           :::image type="content" source="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\student-table-foreign-key-azure-data-studio.png" alt-text="Screenshot Student table in Table Designer showing Foreign Key settings." lightbox="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\student-table-foreign-key-azure-data-studio.png":::

    - Course Table

        :::image type="content" source="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\course-table-azure-data-studio.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Course Table in Table Designer." lightbox="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\course-table-azure-data-studio.png":::

       Be sure to configure the Primary Key settings for the **Course** Table as shown below:
          :::image type="content" source="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\course-table-primary-key-azure-data-studio.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Course table in Table Designer showing Primary Key settings." lightbox="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\course-table-primary-key-azure-data-studio.png":::

    - Credit Table

        :::image type="content" source="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\credit-table-azure-data-studio.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Credit Table in Table Designer." lightbox="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\credit-table-azure-data-studio.png":::

       Be sure to configure the Foreign Key settings for the **Credit** Table as shown below:
        :::image type="content" source="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\credit-table-foreign-key-azure-data-studio.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Credit Table in Table Designer showing Foreign Key settings." lightbox="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\credit-table-foreign-key-azure-data-studio.png":::

       Be sure to configure the Check Constraint settings for the **Credit** Table as shown below:
        :::image type="content" source="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\credit-table-check-constraint-azure-data-studio.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Credit Table in Table Designer showing Check Constraint settings." lightbox="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\credit-table-check-constraint-azure-data-studio.png":::

    If you're prefer to use T-SQL to create the four new tables, here's the T-SQL to execute in a new query window.

    ```sql
    -- Create Person table
    CREATE TABLE Person
    (
        PersonId INT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
        FirstName NVARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
        MiddelInitial NVARCHAR(10),
        LastName NVARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
        DateOfBirth DATE NOT NULL
    )

    -- Create Student table
    CREATE TABLE Student
    (
        StudentId INT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
        PersonId INT REFERENCES Person (PersonId),
        Email NVARCHAR(256)
    )

    -- Create Course table
    CREATE TABLE Course
    (
        CourseId INT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
        Name NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        Teacher NVARCHAR(256) NOT NULL
    )

    -- Create Credit table
    CREATE TABLE Credit
    (
        StudentId INT REFERENCES Student (StudentId),
        CourseId INT REFERENCES Course (CourseId),
        Grade DECIMAL(5,2) CHECK (Grade <= 100.00),
        Attempt TINYINT,
        CONSTRAINT [UQ_studentgrades] UNIQUE CLUSTERED
        (
            StudentId, CourseId, Grade, Attempt
        )
    )
    ```

1. Expand the **Tables** node under *yourDatabase* in the **Object Explorer** to see the four new tables you created.

   :::image type="content" source="media\design-first-database-azure-data-studio\azure-data-studio-tables-created.png" alt-text="Screenshot of created tables in ADS.":::

## Load data into the tables

1. Create a folder called *sampleData* in your local workstation *Downloads* folder to store sample data for your database. For example, `c:\Users\<your user name>\Downloads`.

1. Right-click the following links and save them into the *sampleData* folder.

   - [SampleCourseData](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/sqldbtutorial/SampleCourseData)
   - [SamplePersonData](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/sqldbtutorial/SamplePersonData)
   - [SampleStudentData](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/sqldbtutorial/SampleStudentData)
   - [SampleCreditData](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/sqldbtutorial/SampleCreditData)

1. Open a new Windows command prompt window and navigate to the *sampleData* folder. For example, `cd c:\Users\<your user name>\Downloads`.

1. Execute the following `bcp` commands to insert sample data into the tables replacing the values for *server*, *database*, *user*, and *password* with the values for your environment.

   ```cmd
   bcp Course in SampleCourseData -S <server>.database.windows.net -d <database> -U <user> -P <password> -q -c -t ","
   bcp Person in SamplePersonData -S <server>.database.windows.net -d <database> -U <user> -P <password> -q -c -t ","
   bcp Student in SampleStudentData -S <server>.database.windows.net -d <database> -U <user> -P <password> -q -c -t ","
   bcp Credit in SampleCreditData -S <server>.database.windows.net -d <database> -U <user> -P <password> -q -c -t ","
   ```

You have now loaded sample data into the tables you created earlier.

## Query data

Execute the following T-SQL queries to retrieve information from the database tables.

This first query joins all four tables to find the students taught by 'Dominick Pope' who have a grade higher than 75%. In a query window, execute the following T-SQL query:

   ```sql
   -- Find the students taught by Dominick Pope who have a grade higher than 75%
   SELECT  person.FirstName, person.LastName, course.Name, credit.Grade
   FROM  Person AS person
       INNER JOIN Student AS student ON person.PersonId = student.PersonId
       INNER JOIN Credit AS credit ON student.StudentId = credit.StudentId
       INNER JOIN Course AS course ON credit.CourseId = course.courseId
   WHERE course.Teacher = 'Dominick Pope'
       AND Grade > 75;
   ```

This query joins all four tables and finds the courses in which 'Noe Coleman' has ever enrolled. In a query window, execute the following T-SQL query:

   ```sql
   -- Find all the courses in which Noe Coleman has ever enrolled
   SELECT  course.Name, course.Teacher, credit.Grade
   FROM  Course AS course
       INNER JOIN Credit AS credit ON credit.CourseId = course.CourseId
       INNER JOIN Student AS student ON student.StudentId = credit.StudentId
       INNER JOIN Person AS person ON person.PersonId = student.PersonId
   WHERE person.FirstName = 'Noe'
       AND person.LastName = 'Coleman';
   ```
