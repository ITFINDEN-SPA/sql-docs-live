# Configure log shipping for SQL Server on Azure VMs

[!INCLUDE [appliesto-sqlvm](../../includes/appliesto-sqlvm.md)]

This article teaches you to configure [log shipping](/sql/database-engine/log-shipping/about-log-shipping-sql-server) between two [SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)](sql-server-on-azure-vm-iaas-what-is-overview.md). 

## Overview

Log shipping allows you to automatically send transaction log backups from a *primary database* on a *primary server* to one or more *secondary databases* on a separate *secondary server*. Transaction log backups are applied to each of the secondary databases individually. An optional third server, known as the *monitor server*, records the history and status of backup and restore operations and, optionally, raises alerts if these operations fail to occur as scheduled.

Log shipping is primarily used as a disaster recovery solution and can be combined with other high availability and disaster recovery options, including [Always On availability groups](availability-group-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure log shipping for SQL Server on Azure VMs, you must have the following prerequisites:

- At least two domain-joined Azure virtual machines with SQL Server in the same resource group as an [Azure storage account](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview) for transaction log backups. The secondary server must be on the same or higher version of SQL Server as the primary SQL Server.

- The primary database must use the full or bulk-logged recovery model. Log shipping stops functioning if the primary database is switched to a simple recovery model.

- The account configuring log shipping must be a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role.

## Create Azure File Share

Transaction log backups from the primary server are stored in a file share. Before you configure log shipping, you must create an [Azure File Share](/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction) inside of an Azure storage account that can be accessed by both the primary and secondary servers.

To create your Azure file share in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. Go to your resource group in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the storage account you intend to use for transaction log backups.

1. Under **Data Storage**, select **File Shares**, and then choose **+File share** to create a new file share.

   :::image type="content" source="media/log-shipping-configure/create-azure-file-share.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the File share creation option in the Azure portal.":::

1. On the **Basics** tab, provide the name of the file share, such as **log-shipping**. You can leave the **Tier** at the default of *Transaction optimized*.

1. (Optional) On the **Backup** tab, use the checkbox to enable backups of your file share to [Azure Backup](/azure/backup/azure-file-share-backup-overview).

1. Select **Review + create** to review your file share settings, and then select **Create** to create your new file share.

### Create backup directories

After the file share is created, you should create the following two directories:

- A directory for the primary to write the log backups to
- A directory for the secondary to copy and restore the log backup

To create the directories, follow these steps:

1. After Azure creates the file share, the portal returns you to the **Overview** page for your new SMB File.

1. Under **Browse**, select **+ Add directory**. Provide the name of the new directory, such as **log-backups**. Select **OK**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/log-shipping-configure/create-file-share-directory.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the add directory creation option in the Azure portal." lightbox="media/log-shipping-configure/create-file-share-directory.png":::

1. Repeat the previous step to add a second directory, such as **restore-backups**. Select **OK**.

### Connect VMs to file share

After the directories are created, connect the virtual machines to the file share.

To determine connection details, select **Connect** from either the **Browse** or **Overview** page of the file share to open the **Connect** window.

:::image type="content" source="media/log-shipping-configure/file-share-connect.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Connect option for the file share in the Azure portal.":::

The **Connect** window provides a script to allow a resource to access the file share. Optionally, change the **Drive letter** to mount the file share to the virtual machine. This guide uses a storage account key for a Windows virtual machine.

Select **Show script** to view the script, copy it, and then run it on each SQL Server VM where you plan to configure log shipping.

After running the **Connect** script, you can use the following PowerShell cmdlet to verify connectivity to port 445:

```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName yourstorageaccount.file.core.windows.net -Port 445
```

If the connection test succeeds, you see an output of `TcpTestSucceeded : True`.

### Grant SQL Server access to file share

After the SQL Server VMs can successfully connect to the file share, grant the SQL Server service account permission to access the file share by creating a credential in SQL Server using the URL, username, and password from the **Connect** script.

To create the credential, enable [`xp_cmdshell`](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/xp-cmdshell-transact-sql), and use it to create the credential before disabling `xp_cmdshell` once more.

To grant the SQL Server service account access to the file share, follow these steps on every SQL Server instance that you plan to use for log shipping:

1. Connect to the SQL Server VM with an account that is part of the **sysadmin** role.

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and connect to your SQL Server instance.

1. Open a new query window and run the following Transact-SQL code containing the storage key details obtained from the Azure portal:

   ```sql
   EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
   RECONFIGURE;
   exec sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;
   RECONFIGURE;
   GO
   EXEC xp_cmdshell 'cmdkey /add:"yourstorageaccount.file.core.windows.net" /user:"localhost\yourstorageaccount" /pass:"<yourpasskey>"';
   GO
   EXEC sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 0;
   RECONFIGURE;
   GO
   ```

   After executing the command, SSMS confirms that your credential is added successfully:

## Configure log shipping

After the SQL Server instances can access the file share, use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to configure log shipping.

To configure log shipping, follow these steps:

1. Connect to your primary SQL Server instance.

1. Right-click the database you want to use as your primary database in the log shipping configuration, and then select **Properties**.

1. Under **Select a page**, select **Transaction Log Shipping**.

1. Check the box next to **Enable this as a primary database in a log shipping configuration**.

1. Under **Transaction log backups**, select **Backup Settings**.

1. In the **Network path to the backup folder** box, type the network path to the share and directory you created for the transaction log backup folder.

   For example: `\\yourstorageaccount.file.core.windows.net\log-shipping\log-backups`

1. Configure the **Delete files older than** and **Alert if no backup occurs within** parameters to suit your business needs.

   1. Note the backup schedule listed in the **Schedule** box under **Backup job**. If you want to customize the schedule for your installation, then select **Schedule** and adjust the SQL Server Agent schedule as needed.

   1. SQL Server supports [backup compression](/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/backup-compression-sql-server). When creating a log shipping configuration, you can control the backup compression behavior of log backups by choosing one of the following options: **Use the default server setting**, **Compress backup**, or **Do not compress backup**. For more information, see [Log Shipping Transaction Log Backup Settings](/sql/relational-databases/databases/log-shipping-transaction-log-backup-settings).

   1. Select **OK** to save your settings.

1. Under **Secondary server instances and databases**, select **Add**.

1. Use **Connect** to connect to the instance of SQL Server that you want to use as your secondary server.

   1. In the **Secondary Database** box, choose a database from the list or type the name of the database you want to create.

   1. On the **Initialize Secondary database** tab, choose the option that you want to use to initialize the secondary database.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > If you choose to have SSMS initialize the secondary database from a database backup, the data and log files of the secondary database are placed in the same location as the data and log files of the `master` database. This location is likely to be different than the location of the data and log files of the primary database.

1. On the **Copy Files** tab, in the **Destination folder for copied files** box, type the path of the folder where you want to copy the transaction logs backups, such as the restore-backups directory you created for your file share:

   `\\yourstorageaccount.file.core.windows.net\log-shipping\restore-backups`

   1. Note the copy schedule listed in the **Schedule** box under **Copy job**. If you want to customize the schedule for your installation, select **Schedule** and then adjust the SQL Server Agent schedule as needed. This schedule should approximate the backup schedule.

1. On the **Restore** tab, under **Database state when restoring backups**, choose the **No recovery mode** or **Standby mode** option.

   > [!IMPORTANT]  
   > **Standby mode** is only an option when the version of the primary and secondary server are the same. When the major version of the secondary server is higher than the primary, only **No recovery mode** is allowed.

   1. If you select **Standby mode**, choose if you want to disconnect users from the secondary database while the restore operation is underway.

   1. If you want to delay the restore process on the secondary server, choose a delay time under **Delay restoring backups at least**.

   1. Choose an alert threshold under **Alert if no restore occurs within**.

   1. Note the restore schedule listed in the **Schedule** box under **Restore job**. If you want to customize the schedule for your installation, select **Schedule** and then adjust the SQL Server Agent schedule as needed. This schedule should approximate the backup schedule.

   1. Select **OK** to save your settings.

1. (Optional) Under **Monitor server instance**, select the **Use a monitor server instance** check box, and then select **Settings**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]  
   > To monitor this log shipping configuration, you must add the monitor server now. To add the monitor server later, the log shipping configuration has to be removed, and replaced with a new configuration that includes a monitor server.

   1. Use **Connect** to connect to the instance of SQL Server that you want to use as your monitor server.

   1. Under **Monitor connections**, choose the connection method to be used by the backup, copy, and restore jobs to connect to the monitor server.

   1. Under **History retention**, choose the length of time you want to retain a record of your log shipping history.

   1. Select **OK** to save  your settings.

1. On the **Database Properties** dialog box, use **OK** to begin the configuration process.
