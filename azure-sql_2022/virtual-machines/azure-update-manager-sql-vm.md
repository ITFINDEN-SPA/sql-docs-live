# Azure Update Manager for SQL Server on Azure VMs 

[!INCLUDE [appliesto-sqlvm](../includes/appliesto-sqlvm.md)]

This article explains how to integrate Azure Update Manager with your [SQL virtual machines](windows/manage-sql-vm-portal.md) resource for your SQL Server on [Windows](windows/sql-server-on-azure-vm-iaas-what-is-overview.md) or [Linux](linux/sql-server-on-linux-vm-what-is-iaas-overview.md) Azure Virtual Machines (VMs). With Azure Update Manager, you can automatically install Cumulative Updates for your SQL Server, as well as SQL Server and OS updates marked as Critical or Important.

## Overview

[Azure Update Manager](/azure/update-center/overview) is a unified service to help you manage and govern updates for all your virtual machines and SQL Server instances at scale. Unlike with [Automated Patching](windows/automated-patching.md#migrate-from-automated-patching-to-azure-update-manager), Azure Update Manager installs Cumulative Updates for SQL Server.

With the Azure Update Manager, you can:

- Perform updates on demand
- Manage updates at scale for multiple VMs
- Configure schedules for your patches within designated maintenance windows
- Perform periodic assessments, which automatically check your VMs for updates every 24 hours and reports machines out of compliance

> [!CAUTION]  
> You should use either Azure Update Manager or Automated Patching to manage automatic updates for your SQL Server VM, but not both. Enabling both Automated Patching and Azure Update Manager could lead to unexpected behavior, scheduling conflicts, and unintentional changes outside of designated maintenance windows. Disable Automated Patching before using Azure Update Manager or [migrate directly to Azure Update Manager using PowerShell](windows/automated-patching.md).

## Enable Azure Update Manager

You can enable Azure Update Manager for your SQL Server VM through the Azure portal.

### [Windows](#tab/windows)

1. Go to your [SQL virtual machines](windows/manage-sql-vm-portal.md) resource in the Azure portal.
1. Select **Updates** under **Settings** in the resource menu.
1. Choose **Disable** to disable **Automated Patching** as you shouldn't use Azure Update Manager if you've enabled Automated Patching.
1. Select **Try Azure Update Manager** from the navigation bar to open the new **Updates** page, which integrates Azure Update Manager into your SQL virtual machines resource. If you see **Leave new experience** instead, then you've already enabled Azure Update Manager integration and no further action is necessary.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-update-manager-sql-vm/updates.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the updates page for the Windows SQL virtual machines resource in the Azure portal with Try Azure Update Manager highlighted.":::

1. (Optional) If you want to go back to Automated Patching, select **Leave new experience** to go back to the Automated Patching page, and then select **Enable** to enable Automated Patching. This disables the Azure Update Manager integration.
1. On the **Updates** page, select **Settings** from the navigation bar and then choose **Enable Microsoft updates** to allow SQL Server VMs to receive updates.

### [Linux](#tab/linux)

1. Go to your Linux virtual machine resource in the Azure portal.

1. Select **Updates** under **Operations** in the resource menu.

1. Choose **Disable** to disable **Automated Patching** as you shouldn't use Azure Update Manager if you've enabled Automated Patching.

1. Select **Try Azure Update Manager** from the navigation bar to open the new **Updates** page, which integrates Azure Update Manager into your virtual machine resource. If you see **Leave new experience** instead, then you've already enabled Azure Update Manager integration and no further action is necessary.

1. (Optional) If you want to go back to Automated Patching, select **Leave new experience** to go back to the Automated Patching page, and then select **Enable** to enable Automated Patching. This disables the Azure Update Manager integration.

## Check for updates

Although Azure Update Manager offers a robust scheduling tool for your updates, you can manually check for updates by choosing **Check for updates** from the navigation bar, and then selecting **OK** to trigger the assessment now.

After the assessment completes, refresh Azure Update Manager by selecting **Refresh** from the navigation bar to display the list of all available updates, including SQL Server Cumulative Updates.

## On demand updates

If you want to install a specific update on demand, choose **One-time update** from the navigation bar to open the **Install one-time updates** page.

By default, the **Machines** tab of the **Install one-time updates** page displays the SQL Server VM that you already have open, but you can choose **Add machine** to add additional virtual machines that you want to update on demand.

To update your machines, follow these steps:

1. Check the box next to the machines you want to update, and then select **Next** to navigate to the **Updates** tab.
1. On the **Updates** tab, choose the type of updates you want to install based on their classification, KB ID, or after a specific patch publish date.
1. Check the updates that will be installed based on your selection in the **Preview of selected updates to install** section. Updates that require a restart of the VM have a **Reboot status** of *CanRequestReboot*.
1. Select **Next** and choose the installation properties that best suit your needs, such as when to reboot the VM.
1. Select **Next** to perform a final review of your options, and then select **Install** to start your patching process.

## Update management at scale

One of the benefits of the Azure Update Manager is the ability to manage your entire fleet of SQL Server on Azure VMs from one place. From Azure Update Manager, you can filter based on subscriptions, resource groups, and workloads.

You can access the Azure Update Manager by typing **Azure Update Manager** in the portal search box, or by choosing **Azure Update Manager** from the **Updates** page of the SQL virtual machines resource.

To update multiple SQL Server VMs, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Azure Update Manager** in the Azure portal.
1. Select **Machines** under **Manage**.
1. Filter the workload by **SQL virtual machine**.
1. Check the boxes next to the machines you want to update, and then select **Enable Microsoft updates** from the navigation bar to allow Microsoft updates to all of the chosen VMs.
1. To update the chosen VMs, first select **Check for updates** to determine if any updates are available for the selected VMs.
1. Next, select either **One-time update** to perform an update on demand, or **Schedule updates** to create a schedule to update the selected VMs.

## Periodic assessments

Another benefit of the Azure Update Manager is the ability to use [periodic assessments](/azure/update-center/assessment-options#periodic-assessment) to automatically check for available updates for your SQL Server VMs, and verify if your all VMs are in compliance from a central place. Update Manager checks for updates every 24 hours for each VM that has periodic assessments enabled.

You can enable periodic assessments for a specific SQL Server VM by selecting **Enable now** next to **Periodic assessment** on the **Recommended updates** tab from your **Updates** page of the SQL virtual machines resource.

Alternatively, to enable periodic assessments for multiple SQL Server VMs, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Azure Update Manager** in the Azure portal.
1. Select **Machines** under **Manage**.
   - For Windows, filter the workload by **SQL virtual machine**.
   - For Linux, filter the workload by **OS**.
1. Check the boxes next to the machines you want to enable periodic assessments on, and then select **Update settings** from the **Settings** dropdown list in the navigation bar.
1. Select **Update settings** on the **Update Settings** dialog box to go to the **Change update settings page**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-update-manager-sql-vm/update-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure Update Manager center page with update settings highlighted in the Azure portal. ":::

1. You can update the **Periodic assessment** setting for the machines you selected in the Azure Update Manager and you can also choose **Add machine** to configure settings for additional machines.
1. Select **Save** once you're done making your changes to navigate back to the Azure Update Manager.

## Schedule updates

Azure Update Manager offers robust [scheduling capabilities](/azure/update-center/prerequsite-for-schedule-patching). You can create a schedule for a single VM, or assign multiple machines to the same schedule, giving you greater flexibility and control over when your fleet of SQL Server VMs is patched.

You can configure a schedule for a specific SQL Server VM by selecting **Schedule updates** from the **Updates** page of the [SQL virtual machines](windows/manage-sql-vm-portal.md) resource, or you can configure schedules for multiple VMs by selecting **Schedule updates** from the Azure Update Manager.

To configure a schedule for multiple SQL Server VMs, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Azure Update Manager** in the Azure portal.
1. Select **Machines** under **Manage**.
   - For Windows, filter the workload by **SQL virtual machine**.
   - For Linux, filter the workload by **OS**.
1. Check the boxes next to the machines you want to configure a schedule for, to open the **Create a maintenance configuration** page.
1. On the **Basics** tab, fill out details for your subscription, resource group, and configuration details, such as the name of your schedule.
1. Select **Add a schedule** to define your maintenance window.
1. (Optional) On the **Updates** tab, select **Include update classification**, and then check the box next to **Updates** if you want to install SQL Server Cumulative updates automatically within the specified schedule. Select **Add** to save your settings.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-update-manager-sql-vm/update-classification.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create a maintenance configuration page choosing updates as classification in the Azure portal." lightbox="media/azure-update-manager-sql-vm/update-classification.png":::

1. Select **Review + create** to create your schedule.
1. After the schedule is created, go back to the **Azure Update Manager** and select the VMs you want to use the new schedule.
1. Select **Update settings** on the **Update Settings** dialog box to go to the **Change update settings page**.
1. Update the **Patch orchestration** option to **Customer Managed Schedules** to ensure your VMs are patched based on your chosen schedule instead of autopatched based on default Microsoft settings.

## Migrate from Automated Patching to Azure Update Manager

If you're currently using [Automated Patching](windows/automated-patching.md), and want to migrate to Azure Update Manager, you can do so by using the [MigrateSQLVMPatchingSchedule](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MigrateSQLVMPatchingSchedule-Module) PowerShell module to perform following steps:

- Disable Automated Patching
- Enable Microsoft Update on the virtual machine
- Create a new maintenance configuration in Azure Update Manager with a similar schedule to Automated Patching
- Assign the virtual machine to the maintenance configuration 

To migrate to Azure Update Manager by using PowerShell, use the following sample script: 

```azurepowershell
$rgname = 'YourResourceGroup'
$vmname = 'YourVM'

# Install latest migration module
Install-Module -Name MigrateSQLVMPatchingSchedule-Module -Force -AllowClobber 

# Import the module
Import-Module MigrateSQLVMPatchingSchedule-Module

Convert-SQLVMPatchingSchedule -ResourceGroupName $rgname -VmName $vmname
```

The output of the script includes details about the old schedule in Automated Patching and details about the new schedule in Azure Update Manager. For example, if the Automated Patching schedule was every Friday, with a start hour of 2am, and a duration of 150 minutes, the output from the script is:

## Considerations

Consider the following:

- [Automated patching via the SQL Server IaaS Agent extension](./windows/automated-patching.md) is incompatible with the Azure Update Manager. If you choose to use the Azure Update Manager to manage your SQL Server VMs, be sure to disable automated patching to avoid unexpected and unscheduled patching.
- Azure Update Manager isn't aware if you have an Always On availability group configured for your SQL Server VM, so be cautious when creating your patching schedules for your availability group replicas to avoid unexpected failovers.
