# Database watcher data collection and datasets (preview)

[!INCLUDE [sqldb-sqlmi](./includes/appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi.md)]

Database watcher collects monitoring data from SQL system views and ingests it into the data store in the form of **datasets**. Each dataset is formed using the data from one or more SQL system views. For each dataset, there is a separate table in the data store.

## Data collection

Database watcher collects monitoring data at periodic intervals using T-SQL queries. Data collected in each execution of a query is called a **sample**. Sample collection frequency varies by dataset. For example, frequently changing data such as SQL performance counters might be collected every 10 seconds, while mostly static data such as database configuration might be collected every five minutes. For more information, see [Datasets](#datasets).

Database watcher takes advantage of [streaming ingestion](/azure/data-explorer/ingest-data-streaming) in [Azure Data Explorer](/azure/data-explorer/data-explorer-overview) and [Real-Time Analytics in Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/real-time-analytics/overview) to provide near real time monitoring. Typically, collected SQL monitoring data becomes available for reporting and analysis in less than 10 seconds. You can monitor data ingestion latency on the database watcher [dashboards](database-watcher-overview.md#dashboards), using the **Ingestion statistics** link.

### Interaction between database watcher and application workloads

Enabling database watcher is not likely to have an observable impact on the application workloads. More frequent monitoring queries typically execute in the sub-second range, whereas queries that might require more time, for example to return large datasets, run at infrequent intervals.

To further reduce the risk of impact to application workloads, all database watcher queries in Azure SQL Database are resource-governed as an [internal workload](./database/resource-limits-logical-server.md#resource-consumption-by-user-workloads-and-internal-processes). When resource contention is present, resource consumption by monitoring queries is limited to a small fraction of total resources available to a database or an elastic pool. This prioritizes application workloads over monitoring queries.

In Azure SQL Managed Instance, you can enable [Resource Governor](/sql/relational-databases/resource-governor/resource-governor) to manage resource consumption by the monitoring queries in a similar fashion, if necessary.

The following example configures Resource Governor on a SQL managed instance. It limits CPU consumption by database watcher queries to 30% when there is no CPU contention. When there is CPU contention, this configuration reserves 5% of CPU for the monitoring queries and limits their CPU usage to 10%. It also limits the memory grant size for each monitoring query to 10% of the available memory.

```sql
USE master;
GO

CREATE OR ALTER FUNCTION dbo.dbw_classifier()
RETURNS sysname
WITH SCHEMABINDING
AS
BEGIN

DECLARE @WorkloadGroupName sysname = 'default';

IF APP_NAME() IN (N'SQLExternalMonitoring',N'x_ms_reserved_sql_external_monitoring')
    SET @WorkloadGroupName = N'database_watcher_workload_group'

RETURN @WorkloadGroupName;

END;
GO

BEGIN TRY

IF EXISTS (
          SELECT 1
          FROM sys.resource_governor_configuration
          WHERE classifier_function_id <> 0 OR is_enabled <> 0
          )
    THROW 50001, 'Resource Governor is already configured. No changes were made.', 1;

CREATE RESOURCE POOL database_watcher_resource_pool
WITH (MIN_CPU_PERCENT = 5, MAX_CPU_PERCENT = 10, CAP_CPU_PERCENT = 30);

CREATE WORKLOAD GROUP database_watcher_workload_group
WITH (REQUEST_MAX_MEMORY_GRANT_PERCENT = 10)
USING database_watcher_resource_pool;

ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR WITH (CLASSIFIER_FUNCTION = dbo.dbw_classifier);

ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE;

END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    THROW;
END CATCH;
```

> [!NOTE]
> To make Resource Governor configuration immediately effective on a high availability secondary replica of a SQL managed instance, connect to the replica and execute `ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE;`.

To avoid concurrency conflicts such as blocking and deadlocks between data collection and database workloads running on your Azure SQL resources, monitoring queries use short [lock timeouts](/sql/relational-databases/sql-server-transaction-locking-and-row-versioning-guide#customizing-the-lock-time-out) and low [deadlock priority](/sql/t-sql/statements/set-deadlock-priority-transact-sql). If there is a concurrency conflict, priority is given to the application workload queries. Depending on the application workload patterns, this might cause occasional gaps in collected data for some datasets.

### Data collection in elastic pools

To monitor an elastic pool, you must designate one database in the pool as the **anchor database**. Database watcher connects to the anchor database. Because the watcher [holds](database-watcher-overview.md#watcher-authorization) the `VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE` permission, system views in the anchor database provide monitoring data for the pool as a whole.

> [!TIP]
> You can add an empty database to each elastic pool you want to monitor, and designate it as the anchor database. This way, you can move other databases in and out of the pool, or between pools, without interrupting elastic pool monitoring.

Data collected from the anchor database contains pool-level metrics, and certain database-level performance metrics for every database in the pool. For example, this includes resource utilization and request rate metrics for each database. For some scenarios, monitoring an elastic pool as a whole makes it unnecessary to monitor each individual database in the pool.

Certain monitoring data such as pool-level CPU, memory, and storage utilization, and wait statistics is only collected at the elastic pool level because it cannot be attributed to an individual database in a pool. Conversely, certain other data such as query runtime statistics, database properties, table and index metadata is available only at the database level.

If you add individual databases from an elastic pool as database watcher targets, you should add the elastic pool as a target as well. This way, you get a more complete view of the database and pool performance.

#### Monitor dense elastic pools

A [dense elastic pool](./database/elastic-pool-resource-management.md) contains a large number of databases, but has a relatively small compute size. This configuration lets customers achieve substantial cost savings by keeping the compute resource allocation to a minimum on the assumption that only a small number of databases in the pool are active at the same time.

Compute resources available to database watcher queries in a dense elastic pool are further limited to avoid affecting application queries. Because of this, database watcher might not be able to collect monitoring data from every database in a dense elastic pool.

> [!TIP]
> To monitor a dense elastic pool, enable monitoring at the pool level by adding the elastic pool as a target.
>
> It is not recommended to monitor more than a few individual databases in a dense elastic pool. You might see gaps in the collected data or larger than expected intervals between data samples due to insufficient compute resources available to database watcher queries.

# [SQL database](#tab/sqldb)

| Column name | Description |
|:--|:--|
| `subscription_id` | The Azure subscription ID of the SQL database. |
| `resource_group_name` | The resource group name of the SQL database. |
| `resource_id` | The Azure resource ID of the SQL database. |
| `sample_time_utc` | The time when the values in the row were observed, in UTC. |
| `collection_time_utc` | The time when the row was collected by the watcher, in UTC. This column is present in datasets where collection time might be different from sample time. |

| `logical_database_id` | A unique database identifier that remains unchanged over the lifetime of the user database. Renaming the database or changing its service objective do not change this value. |
| `physical_database_id` | A unique database identifier for the current physical database corresponding to the user database. Changing database service objective causes this value to change. |
| `replica_id` | A unique identifier for a Hyperscale [compute replica](./database/hyperscale-architecture.md). |

# [SQL elastic pool](#tab/sqlep)

| Column name | Description |
|:--|:--|
| `subscription_id` | The Azure subscription ID of the SQL elastic pool. |
| `resource_group_name` | The resource group name of the SQL elastic pool. |
| `resource_id` | The Azure resource ID of the SQL elastic pool. |
| `sample_time_utc` | The time when the values in the row were observed, in UTC. |
| `collection_time_utc` | The time when the row was collected by the watcher, in UTC. This column is present in datasets where collection time might be different from sample time. |

# [SQL managed instance](#tab/sqlmi)

| Column name | Description |
|:--|:--|
| `subscription_id` | The Azure subscription ID of the SQL managed instance. |
| `resource_group_name` | The resource group name of the SQL managed instance. |
| `resource_id` | The Azure resource ID of the SQL managed instance. |
| `sample_time_utc` | The time when the values in the row were observed, in UTC. |
| `collection_time_utc` | The time when the row was collected by the watcher, in UTC. This column is present in datasets where collection time might be different from sample time. |
| `replica_type` | One of: **Primary**, **HA secondary**, **Geo-replication forwarder**. |

---

A dataset has both `sample_time_utc` and `collection_time_utc` columns if it contains samples observed before the row was collected by database watcher. Otherwise, the observation time and collection time are the same, and the dataset contains only the `sample_time_utc` column.

For example, the `sqldb_database_resource_utilization` dataset is derived from the [sys.dm_db_resource_stats](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-resource-stats-azure-sql-database) dynamic management view (DMV). The DMV contains the `end_time` column, which is the observation time for each row reporting aggregate resource statistics for a 15-second interval. This time is reported in the `sample_time_utc` column. When database watcher queries this DMV, the result set might contain multiple rows, each with a different `end_time`. All of these rows have the same `collection_time_utc` value.
