# Update policy in Azure SQL Managed Instance
[!INCLUDE [appliesto-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqlmi.md)]

This article describes the update policy for [Azure SQL Managed Instance](sql-managed-instance-paas-overview.md), and how to modify it. The update policy is an instance setting that controls access to the latest SQL engine features in Azure. 

Azure SQL Managed Instance offers the following two update policies: 

- **SQL Server 2022** update policy: The instance can only use SQL engine features available in SQL Server 2022 as the internal database format is aligned with SQL Server 2022.
- **Always-up-to-date** update policy: The instance has access to all SQL engine features as soon as they're available in Azure. The internal database format is no longer aligned with the latest version of SQL Server, and instead evolves with each newly introduced feature.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Regardless of the configured update policy, all instances will continue receiving updates and features that _don't_ require changes to the SQL engine, such as the following features:  [zone redundancy](high-availability-sla-local-zone-redundancy.md#zone-redundant-availability), [instance stop and start](instance-stop-start-how-to.md), and [fast provisioning](management-operations-overview.md?#fast-provisioning). 

## SQL Server 2022 update policy

The **SQL Server 2022** update policy aligns your database format with SQL Server 2022. 

When using the SQL Server 2022 update policy, consider the following:

- The **SQL Server 2022** update policy is the default update policy for all existing and newly deployed instances. 
- Your internal database format remains aligned with SQL Server 2022. 
- You receive all the latest updates available for SQL Server 2022. 
- You can [restore your database](restore-database-to-sql-server.md) to SQL Server 2022 from Azure SQL Managed Instance. 
- You can configure a [link](managed-instance-link-disaster-recovery.md) for real-time data replication, bidirectional failover, and disaster recovery between SQL Server 2022 and Azure SQL Managed Instance. 
- You might not have access to some of the latest SQL engine features and benefits available to Azure SQL Managed Instance with the **Always-up-to-date** update policy. 
- The **SQL Server 2022** update policy is available until the [end of mainstream support of SQL Server 2022](/lifecycle/products/sql-server-2022), at which point, the update policy for instances using the **SQL Server 2022** update policy are automatically updated to the update policy that corresponds to the latest SQL Server major release available at that time. 


## Always-up-to-date update policy 

The **Always-up-to-date** update policy configures your instance to receive all the latest features and updates available to Azure SQL Managed Instance. 

When using the **Always-up-to-date** update policy, consider the following:

- You're able to use all the new features and benefits available to Azure SQL Managed Instance. 
- Once the **Always-up-to-date** policy is enabled, you can't go back to the **SQL Server 2022** update policy.
- You lose some of the benefits provided by database format alignment with SQL Server 2022, such as the ability to restore your database to SQL Server 2022, and bidirectional failover between your instance and SQL Server 2022 with the [link](managed-instance-link-disaster-recovery.md) feature. 

## Feature comparison

The following table lists all the features that are only available to instances with the designated update policy:


|**SQL Server 2022** update policy  |**Always-up-to-date** update policy  |
|---------|---------|
|[Restore database to SQL Server 2022](restore-database-to-sql-server.md)  <br /> [Link with bidirectional failover and disaster recovery](managed-instance-link-disaster-recovery.md)   | While currently, there aren't any features that are only available to instances with the **Always-up-to-date** update policy, check back soon. |


The following features are impacted by the configured update policy: 

- [Automated backups](automated-backups-overview.md) and [copy-only backups](/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/copy-only-backups-sql-server): Database backups taken from instances configured with the **SQL Server 2022** update policy can be restored to instances configured with either the **SQL Server 2022** or **Always-up-to-date** update policy. Database backups taken from instances configured with the **Always-up-to-date** update policy can only be restored to instances also configured with the **Always-up-to-date** update policy. 
- [Managed Instance link](managed-instance-link-feature-overview.md#limitations): Establishing a link from SQL Managed Instance to SQL Server 2022, or failing back from SQL Server 2022 to SQL Managed Instance is only available to instances with the **SQL Server 2022** update policy. 
- [Database copy and move](database-copy-move-how-to.md#limitations): A database from an instance configured with the **Always-up-to-date** update policy can't be copied or moved to an instance configured with the **SQL Server 2022** update policy. 
- [Failover groups](failover-group-configure-sql-mi.md#change-update-policy): Instances in a failover group must have matching update policies. 

## Existing instances

For an existing instance, you can enable the **Always-up-to-date** update policy by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, the Azure CLI, and REST API. 

> [!CAUTION]
> The **SQL Server 2022** update policy is enabled by default for all existing and new instances. Once the update policy is changed to **Always-up-to-date**, the internal database format is upgraded permanently. You can't change the update policy back to **SQL Server 2022** and can no longer use the features and benefits that require the SQL Server 2022 update policy. 

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

To change the update policy for an existing instance in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. Go to your **SQL managed instance** resource in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). 
1. Select **Maintenance and updates** under **Settings**. 
1. Select the bubble to enable the **Always up-to-date** update policy: 

   :::image type="content" source="media/update-policy/update-policy-existing-instance.md.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the SQL Managed Instance page in the Azure portal, with update policy selected.":::

1. Select **Yes** on the **Confirm update policy change** popup to save your changes. Once the **Always-up-to-date** update policy is enabled, the **SQL Server 2022** update policy is no longer available

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Set `DatabaseFormat` = `AlwaysUpToDate` when you update an existing SQL managed instance with the [Set-AzSqlInstance](/powershell/module/az.sql/set-azsqlinstance#example-9-update-an-existing-instance-with-database-format-and-pricing-model) PowerShell command to configure your instance to use the **Always-up-to-date** update policy. 

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Set `--database-format` = `AlwaysUpToDate` when you update an existing SQL managed instance with the [az sql mi update](/cli/azure/sql/mi#az-sql-mi-update:~:text=Update%20mi%20database%20format%20and%20pricing%20model) Azure CLI command to configure your instance to use the **Always-up-to-date** update policy. 

### [REST API](#tab/rest-api)


Set `databaseFormat` = `AlwaysUpToDate` when you update an existing SQL managed instance with the [Managed Instances - Create Or Update](/rest/api/sql/managed-instances/create-or-update#create-managed-instance-with-all-properties) REST API command to configure your instance to use the **Always-up-to-date** update policy. 

---


## New instances

Although the **SQL Server 2022** update policy is enabled by default, you can choose the **Always-up-to-date** policy when you create your instance by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI and REST API. 

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

To create a new SQL managed instance with the **Always-up-to-date** policy in the Azure portal, follow these steps: 

1. Go to the **Azure SQL** page in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select **+ Create** to open the **Select SQL deployment option**. 
1. In the **SQL managed instances** tile, select *Single instance* from the dropdown, and then select **Create** to open the **Create Azure SQL Managed Instance** page. 
1. On the **Create Azure SQL Managed Instance** page, fill out details for your instance. On the **Additional settings** tab, under **SQL engine updates**, choose the **Always-up-to-date** policy: 

   :::image type="content" source="media/update-policy/update-policy-new-instance.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create Azure SQL Managed Instance page of the Azure portal with update policy selected.":::

1. You can confirm the designated policy under **Update policy** on the **Review + create** tab before you create your new instance. 

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Set `DatabaseFormat` = `AlwaysUpToDate` when you create a new SQL managed instance with the [New-AzSqlInstance](/powershell/module/az.sql/new-azsqlinstance#example-10-create-a-new-instance-with-database-format-and-pricing-model) PowerShell command to create a new instance with the **Always-up-to-date** update policy. 

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Set `--database-format` = `AlwaysUpToDate` when you create a new SQL managed instance with the [az sql mi create](/cli/azure/sql/mi#az-sql-mi-create:~:text=Create%20managed%20instance%20with%20database%20format%20and%20pricing%20model) Azure CLI command to create a new instance with the **Always-up-to-date** update policy. 

### [REST API](#tab/rest-api)

Set `databaseFormat` = `AlwaysUpToDate` when you create a new SQL managed instance with the [Managed Instances - Create Or Update](/rest/api/sql/managed-instances/create-or-update#create-managed-instance-with-all-properties) REST API command to create a new instance with the **Always-up-to-date** update policy.

## Check update policy 

You can check the current update policy by using the Azure portal, or Transact-SQL (T-SQL). 

To check the current update policy in the Azure portal, go to your **SQL managed instance** resource, and then check the **Update policy** field under **Updates and maintenance** in the resource menu. 

You can also use the [serverproperty](/sql/t-sql/functions/serverproperty-transact-sql) T-SQL command: 

```sql
select serverproperty('ProductUpdateType')
```

The following values for `ProductUpdateType` indicate the update policy for the current instance: 
- `CU`: Updates are deployed via cumulative updates (CUs) for the corresponding major SQL Server release (**SQL Server 2022** update policy)
- `Continuous`: New features are brought to Azure SQL Managed Instance as soon as they're available, independent of the SQL Server release cadence (**Always-up-to-date** update policy)
