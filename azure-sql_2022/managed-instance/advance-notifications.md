Advance notifications enable customers to configure notifications to be sent up to 24 hours in advance of any planned event.

Notifications can be configured so you can get texts, emails, Azure push notifications, and voicemails when planned maintenance is due to begin in the next 24 hours. Follow-up notifications are sent when maintenance begins and when maintenance ends.

## Configure an advance notification

Complete the following steps to enable a notification in the Azure portal **Service Health** page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Service health is rolling out new experiences in phases. Some users will see the [updated Azure Service Health portal experience](/azure/service-health/service-health-portal-update), others will still see the classic Service Health portal experience. In case that you still see the classic Service Health portal, for **Region** don't select Global as an option, but rather the specific region or all regions.

1. Go to the [Service Health](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Health/AzureHealthBrowseBlade/~/healthAlerts) page, under **Alerts**, select **Health alerts**. Then select **Create**.

1. In the **Scope** section, select subscription.

1. In the **Condition** section, configure service(s) to be alerted for, region(s) and criteria. For more generic alert, select all values. To narrow down, select Azure SQL Managed Instance as a service, region(s) where you have those services deployed, and **Planned maintenance** for the event type.

    :::image type="content" source="media/advance-notifications/define-condition-services.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal page where you define conditions for the health alert and define services to be notified for." lightbox="media/advance-notifications/define-condition-services.png":::

    :::image type="content" source="media/advance-notifications/define-condition-regions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal page where you define conditions for the health alert and define regions to be notified for." lightbox="media/advance-notifications/define-condition-regions.png":::

    :::image type="content" source="media/advance-notifications/define-condition-event-types.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal page where you define conditions for the health alert and define event types to be notified for.":::

1. In the **Actions** section, select the existing action group or create a new one.

    :::image type="content" source="media/advance-notifications/add-action-group.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal page where you add or create action groups." lightbox="media/advance-notifications/add-action-group.png":::

1. In the **Details** section, define the name for your alert and specify resource group where it should be deployed.

    :::image type="content" source="media/advance-notifications/define-alert-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal page where you define alert details." lightbox="media/advance-notifications/define-alert-details.png":::

1. Select **Tags**. Consider using Azure tags. For example, the "Owner" or "CreatedBy" tag to identify who created the resource, and the "Environment" tag to identify whether this resource is in production, development, etc. For more information, see [Develop your naming and tagging strategy for Azure resources](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging).

1. Select **Review + create**. Your alert is created over the next few minutes.

You're all set. Next time there's a planned Azure SQL maintenance event, you'll receive an advance notification. To learn more about creating health alerts, visit [Azure Service Health](/azure/service-health/service-health-portal-update)

## <a id="tracking-azure-sql-managed-instance-maintenance-events"></a> Track Azure SQL Managed Instance maintenance events

[Azure Service Health](/azure/service-health/service-health-overview) is a combination of three separate smaller services with a purpose of keeping you informed about the health of your cloud resources. This information includes current and upcoming issues such as service affecting events, planned maintenance, and other changes that might affect your availability. Service health (a sub-service) provides a personalized view of the health of the Azure services and regions you're using. This is the best place to look for service affecting planned maintenance activities.

Under the Service Health you can find a **Planned maintenance** page for listing all maintenance activities happening on your subscriptions. You can use built-in filters to narrow the list of events and scope them to tenant, subscription, region, or resource type. 

:::image type="content" source="media/advance-notifications/service-health-planned-maintenance.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure Monitor Service Health page where you can list all maintenance events." lightbox="media/advance-notifications/service-health-planned-maintenance.png":::

From the list of events on the **Service Health | Planned Maintenance** page you can further navigate into each maintenance event and check the details. All maintenance events with the same tracking ID will appear in the **Issue Updates** tab. In the **Impacted Resources**, resources impacted by published maintenance events are listed. 

:::image type="content" source="media/advance-notifications/service-health-planned-maintenance-event.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure Monitor Service Health page with opened single maintenance event containing full event details." lightbox="media/advance-notifications/service-health-planned-maintenance-event.png":::

## <a id="receiving-notifications"></a> Receive notifications

The following table shows the general information notifications you might receive: 

|Status|Description|
|:---|:---|
|**Planned**| Received 24 hours prior to the maintenance event. Maintenance is planned on DATE between 5pm - 8am<sup>1</sup> (local time) in region *region_name*. |
|**InProgress** | Maintenance for database(s) in region *region_name* is starting. | 
|**Complete** | Maintenance of database(s) in region *region_name* is complete. |

<sup>1</sup> Start and end time depend on the selected [maintenance window](maintenance-window.md).

The following table shows additional notifications that might be sent while maintenance is ongoing:

|Status|Description|
|:---|:---|
|**Rescheduled** | - Maintenance is in progress but didn't complete inside maintenance window. <br/>- There was a problem during maintenance and it could not start.<br/> - Planned maintenance has started but couldn't progress to the end and will continue in next maintenance window. |
|**Canceled**| Maintenance for database(s) in region *region_name* is canceled and will be rescheduled for later. |

## Permissions

While Advance Notifications can be sent to any email address, Azure subscription role-based access control (RBAC) policy determines who can access the links in the email. Querying resource graph is covered by [Azure RBAC](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) access management.  To enable read access, each recipient should have resource group level read access. For more information, see [Steps to assign an Azure role](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps).

## Programmatically retrieve the list of impacted resources

[Azure Resource Graph](/azure/governance/resource-graph/overview) is an Azure service designed to extend Azure Resource Management. The Azure Resource Graph Explorer provides efficient and performant resource exploration. You can query at scale across a given set of subscriptions, so that you can effectively govern your environment.

You can use the Azure Resource Graph Explorer to query for maintenance events. For an introduction on how to run these queries, see [Quickstart: Run your first Resource Graph query using Azure Resource Graph Explorer](/azure/governance/resource-graph/first-query-portal).

When the advanced notification for planned maintenance is received, you will get a link that opens Azure Resource Graph and executes the query for the exact event, similar to the following. The `notificationId` value is unique per maintenance event.  

```kusto
resources
| project resource = tolower(id)
| join kind=inner (
    maintenanceresources
    | where type == "microsoft.maintenance/updates"
    | extend p = parse_json(properties)
    | mvexpand d = p.value
    | where d has 'notificationId' and d.notificationId == 'LNPN-R9Z'
    | project resource = tolower(name), status = d.status, resourceGroup, location, startTimeUtc = d.startTimeUtc, endTimeUtc = d.endTimeUtc, impactType = d.impactType
) on resource
| project resource, status, resourceGroup, location, startTimeUtc, endTimeUtc, impactType
```

In Azure Resource Graph (ARG) explorer, you might find values for the status of deployment that are bit different than the ones displayed in the notification content.

|Status|Description|
|:---|:---|
|**Pending**|- Maintenance is planned on upcoming date.<br/> - Previously planned maintenance was rescheduled and is waiting to start in the next window.</br> - Maintenance started but didn't complete in previous window and will continue in the next one. |
|**InProgress** | Maintenance for resource *region_name* is starting or is in progress. | 
|**Completed** | Maintenance for resource *region_name* is complete. |
|**NoUpdatesPending** | Previously planned maintenance for resource *region_name* is canceled and will be rescheduled for later. |
|**RetryLater** | Planned maintenance for resource *region_name* has started but couldn't progress to the end and will continue in next maintenance window. |
