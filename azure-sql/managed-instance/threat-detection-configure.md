# Configure Advanced Threat Protection in Azure SQL Managed Instance
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqlmi.md)]

[Advanced Threat Protection](../database/threat-detection-overview.md) for an [Azure SQL Managed Instance](sql-managed-instance-paas-overview.md) detects anomalous activities indicating unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit databases. Advanced Threat Protection can identify **Potential SQL injection**, **Access from unusual location or data center**, **Access from unfamiliar principal or potentially harmful application**, and **Brute force SQL credentials** - see more details in [Advanced Threat Protection alerts](../database/threat-detection-overview.md#alerts).

You can receive notifications about the detected threats via [email notifications](../database/threat-detection-overview.md#explore-detection-of-a-suspicious-event) or [Azure portal](../database/threat-detection-overview.md#explore-alerts-in-the-azure-portal)

[Advanced Threat Protection](../database/threat-detection-overview.md) is part of the [Microsoft Defender for SQL](../database/azure-defender-for-sql.md)  offering, which is a unified package for advanced SQL security capabilities. Advanced Threat Protection can be accessed and managed via the central Microsoft Defender for SQL portal.
