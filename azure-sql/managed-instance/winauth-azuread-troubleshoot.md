# Troubleshoot Windows Authentication for Microsoft Entra principals on Azure SQL Managed Instance

This article contains troubleshooting steps for use when implementing [Windows Authentication principals](winauth-azuread-overview.md) in Microsoft Entra ID ([formerly Azure Active Directory](/entra/fundamentals/new-name)).

[!INCLUDE [entra-id](../includes/entra-id.md)]

## Verify tickets are getting cached

Use the [klist](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/klist) command to display a list of currently cached Kerberos tickets.

The `klist get krbtgt` command should return a ticket from the on-premises Active Directory realm.

```dos
klist get krbtgt/kerberos.microsoftonline.com
```

The `klist get MSSQLSvc` command should return a ticket from the `kerberos.microsoftonline.com` realm with a Service Principal Name (SPN) to `MSSQLSvc/<miname>.<dnszone>.database.windows.net:1433`.

```dos
klist get MSSQLSvc/<miname>.<dnszone>.database.windows.net:1433
```

The following are some well-known error codes:

- **0x6fb: SQL SPN not found** - Check that you've entered a valid SPN. If you've implemented the incoming trust-based authentication flow, revisit steps to [create and configure the Microsoft Entra Kerberos Trusted Domain Object](winauth-azuread-setup-incoming-trust-based-flow.md#create-and-configure-the-azure-ad-kerberos-trusted-domain-object) to validate that you've performed all the configuration steps.

- **0x51f** - This error is likely related to a conflict with the Fiddler tool. To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

  1. Run `netsh winhttp reset autoproxy`
  2. Run `netsh winhttp reset proxy`
  3. In the Windows registry, find `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\iphlpsvc\Parameters\ProxyMgr` and delete any subentry that has a configuration with a port `:8888`
  4. Restart the machine and try again using Windows Authentication

- **0x52f** - Indicates that a referenced user name and authentication information are valid, but some user account restriction has prevented successful authentication. This can happen if you have a Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policy configured. To mitigate the issue, you must exclude the Azure SQL Managed Instance Service Principal (named `<instance name> principal`) application in the Conditional Access rules.

## Investigate message flow failures

Use Wireshark, or the network traffic analyzer of your choice, to monitor traffic between the client and on-premises Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC).

When using Wireshark the following is expected:

- AS-REQ: Client => on-premises KDC => returns on-premises TGT.
- TGS-REQ: Client => on-premises KDC => returns referral to `kerberos.microsoftonline.com`.
