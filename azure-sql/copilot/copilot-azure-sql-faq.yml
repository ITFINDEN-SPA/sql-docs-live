      - question: |
          Are the results from Copilot reliable?
        answer: |
          Copilot is designed to generate the best possible responses with the database context it has access to. However, like any AI system, responses aren't perfect. All of Copilot's responses should be carefully tested, reviewed, and vetted before making changes to your Azure SQL Database environment.
      - question: |
          Does Copilot write perfect or optimal queries?
        answer: |
          Copilot aims to provide accurate and informative responses based on the available data. The answers generated are based on patterns and probabilities in language data, which means that they might not always be accurate. Humans should carefully review, test, and validate all content generated by Copilot.
      - question: |
          How does Copilot use data from my Azure SQL Database environment?
        answer: |
          Copilot generates responses grounded in your Azure SQL Database environment. Copilot only has access to resources that you have access to and can only perform analysis and actions that you have the permissions to perform. Copilot respects all existing access management and protections.
      - question: |
          What data does Copilot collect?
        answer: |
          User-provided prompts and Copilot's responses aren't used to further train, retrain, or improve Azure OpenAI Service foundation models that generate responses. User-provided prompts and Copilot's responses are collected and used to improve Microsoft products and services only when users have given explicit consent to include this information within feedback. We collect user engagement data, such as, number of chat sessions and session duration, the skill used in a particular session, thumbs up, thumbs down, feedback, etc. This information is retained and used as set forth in the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).

          What should I do if I see unexpected or offensive content?

          The Azure team built Copilot guided by our AI principles and Responsible AI Standard. We have prioritized mitigating exposing customers to offensive content. However, you might still see unexpected results. We're constantly working to improve our technology in preventing harmful content.

          If you encounter harmful or inappropriate content in the system, you can provide feedback or report a concern by selecting the downvote button on the response.
