# Microsoft Copilot skills in Azure SQL Database (preview)

[!INCLUDE [appliesto-sqldb](../includes/appliesto-sqldb.md)]

Microsoft Copilot in Azure is now integrated with Azure SQL Database, enhancing the management and operation of SQL-dependent applications. It improves productivity in the Azure portal by offering natural language to SQL conversion and self-help for database administration.

Copilot provides relevant answers to user questions, simplifying database management by leveraging database context, documentation, dynamic management views, Query Store, and other knowledge sources. For example:

- Database administrators can independently manage databases and resolve issues, or learn more about the performance and capabilities of your database.
- Developers can ask questions about their data as they would in text or conversation to generate a T-SQL query. Developers can also learn to write queries faster through detailed explanations of the generated query.

Copilot integrates data and formulates applicable responses using public documentation, dynamic management views, catalog views, and Azure supportability diagnostics.

## Azure SQL Database experiences

The current preview includes **two distinct experiences**:

- **Microsoft Copilot in Azure integration**: This experience adds Azure SQL Database skills into Microsoft Copilot in Azure, customers with self-guided assistance, empowering them to manage their databases and solve issues independently.

- **Natural language to SQL**: This experience within the Azure portal query editor translates natural language queries into SQL, making database interactions more intuitive. For a tutorial and examples of Copilot's natural language to SQL capabilities in Azure SQL Database, see [Natural language to SQL in the Azure portal query editor (preview)](query-editor-natural-language-to-sql-copilot.md).

### Natural language to SQL query

This experience within the [Azure portal query editor](../database/query-editor.md) utilizes table and view names, column names, primary key, and foreign key metadata to generate T-SQL code. You can then review and execute the code suggestion.

This integration means that [Microsoft Copilot in Azure](/azure/copilot/overview) can answer questions with prompts like:

 - `Which agents have listed more than two properties for sale?`
 - `Tell me the rank of each agent by property sales and show name, total sales, and rank`
 - Even advanced scenarios such as `Show me a pivot summary table that displays the number of properties sold in each year from 2020 to 2023`

For a tutorial and examples of Copilot's natural language to SQL capabilities in Azure SQL Database, see [Natural language to SQL in the Azure portal query editor (preview)](query-editor-natural-language-to-sql-copilot.md).

## Enable Microsoft Copilot in your Azure tenant

For information on enabling Microsoft Copilot, see [Microsoft Copilot for Azure (preview)](/azure/copilot/overview).

## Microsoft Copilot in Azure enhanced scenarios

You can ask and receive helpful, context-rich suggestions from [Microsoft Copilot in Azure](/azure/copilot/overview) within the Azure portal.

> [!WARNING]
> Microsoft Copilot in Azure is a preview set of experiences that are powered by large language models (LLMs). Output produced by Copilot might contain inaccuracies, biases, or other unintended content. As with any generative AI model, humans should review the output produced by Copilot before use.

Some example scenarios for the **Microsoft Copilot in Azure**:

- When you're working with a slow Azure SQL Database, you could provide the prompt `My database is slow`.

   Microsoft Copilot in Azure (preview) starts looking at your database based on your context in the Azure portal. After the check, Copilot will detail specific areas that might be contributing to the issue. In this example, there was a specific query driving high CPU utilization:

   :::image type="content" source="media/copilot-azure-sql-overview/slow-database.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the query prompt and generated sample query about high CPU utilization." lightbox="media/copilot-azure-sql-overview/slow-database.png":::

- You can continue the conversation and investigation with a prompt of `How can I tune that high CPU query?`.

   Copilot understands that this prompt refers to the query identified earlier, and provides a new index suggestion:

   :::image type="content" source="media/copilot-azure-sql-overview/high-cpu-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a second query prompt in the conversation and generated sample query about high CPU utilization." lightbox="media/copilot-azure-sql-overview/high-cpu-query.png":::

## Troubleshooting

In order to answer some questions about your Azure SQL Database, Microsoft Copilot may need to connect to your database in the context of current Azure portal login context and execute queries on dynamic management views and query store system tables.

The following considerations and limitations apply when connecting to Azure SQL Database:

- **Allowlist your IP on your server.** In order to be able to successfully extract necessary information, you need to add your outbound IP address to the server's allowed firewall rules to access your databases. For more information, see [Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse IP firewall rules](../database/firewall-configure.md?view=azuresql-db&preserve-view=true)

- **Open TCP ports 433 and 1433.** You might get persistent errors while executing prompts that try to get information from your database if you haven't enabled outbound port TCP 1433 and 433. These errors occur because Copilot is unable to communicate to your database through ports 443 and 1443. You need to enable outbound HTTPS traffic on these ports. Your corporate IT department might need to grant approval to open this connection on your local network. For more information, see [Azure SQL Database connectivity architecture](../database/connectivity-architecture.md?view=azuresql-db&preserve-view=true).

- **Permissions on your database.** Since Copilot uses operates on behalf of the current user context, if you don't have permissions to execute some DMV queries on your database, Copilot will fail to correctly answer your question. Depending on the system stables or DMVs required to answer the question, the permissions **VIEW DATABASE STATE**, **VIEW SERVER STATE**, or **VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE** might provide necessary access without granting any excess administrative permissions. For more information, see [GRANT Database Permissions (Transact-SQL)](/sql/t-sql/statements/grant-database-permissions-transact-sql?view=azuresqldb-current&preserve-view=true).
