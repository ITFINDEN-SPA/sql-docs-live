For information about Azure SQL, see [Features comparison: Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/azure-sql/database/features-comparison).

Installation requirements vary based on your application needs. The different editions of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] accommodate the unique performance, runtime, and price requirements of organizations and individuals. The [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components that you install also depend on your specific requirements. The following sections help you understand how to make the best choice among the editions and components available in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
