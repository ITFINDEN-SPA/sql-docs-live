## Supported configurations

### SQL Server version

[!INCLUDE [sssql11-md](../../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later versions.

### Operating systems

- Ubuntu 20.04 (x64)

- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 15 (x64)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2 support ended on October 10, 2023. For more information, see [SQL Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012/2012 R2 end of support](/lifecycle/announcements/sql-server-2012-windows-server-2012-2012-r2-end-of-support).

### .NET Framework

On Windows, .NET Framework 4.7.2 and later.

This requirement begins with extension version `1.1.2504.99` (November, 14 2023 release). Without this version, the extension might not function as intended. Windows Server 2012 R2 does not come with .NET Framework 4.7.2 by default and must be updated accordingly.

### Support on VMware

You can deploy SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc in VMware VMs running:

- On-premises
- In VMware solutions, for example:
  - Azure VMware Solution (AVS)

    [!INCLUDE [azure-vmware](azure-vmware.md)]

  - VMware Cloud on AWS
  - Google Cloud VMware Engine
