## Arguments

#### PAD_INDEX = { ON | OFF }

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and later versions

Specifies index padding. The default is `OFF`.

- ON

  The percentage of free space that is specified by `FILLFACTOR` is applied to the intermediate-level pages of the index.

- OFF or *fillfactor* isn't specified

  The intermediate-level pages are filled to near capacity, leaving enough space for at least one row of the maximum size the index can have, given the set of keys on the intermediate pages.

#### FILLFACTOR = *fillfactor*

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and later versions

Specifies a percentage that indicates how full the [!INCLUDE [ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] should make the leaf level of each index page during index creation or alteration. The value specified must be an integer value from 1 to 100. The default is 0.

> [!NOTE]  
> Fill factor values 0 and 100 are identical in all respects.

#### IGNORE_DUP_KEY = { ON | OFF }

Specifies the response type when an insert operation attempts to insert duplicate key values into a unique index. The `IGNORE_DUP_KEY` option applies only to insert operations after the index is created or rebuilt. The option has no effect when executing [CREATE INDEX](create-index-transact-sql.md), [ALTER INDEX](alter-index-transact-sql.md), or [UPDATE](../queries/update-transact-sql.md). The default is `OFF`.

- ON

  A warning message occurs when duplicate key values are inserted into a unique index. Only the rows violating the uniqueness constraint fail.

- OFF

  An error message occurs when duplicate key values are inserted into a unique index. The entire `INSERT` operation is rolled back.

`IGNORE_DUP_KEY` can't be set to `ON` for indexes created on a view, nonunique indexes, XML indexes, spatial indexes, and filtered indexes.

To view `IGNORE_DUP_KEY`, use [sys.indexes](../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-indexes-transact-sql.md).

In backward compatible syntax, `WITH IGNORE_DUP_KEY` is equivalent to `WITH IGNORE_DUP_KEY = ON`.

#### STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = { ON | OFF }

Disable or enable the automatic statistics update option, `AUTO_STATISTICS_UPDATE`, for the statistics related to the specified indexes. The default is `OFF`.

- ON

  Automatic statistics updates are disabled after the index is rebuilt.

- OFF

  Automatic statistics updates are enabled after the index is rebuilt.

To restore automatic statistics updating, set the `STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE` to `OFF`, or execute `UPDATE STATISTICS` without the `NORECOMPUTE` clause.

> [!WARNING]  
> If you disable automatic updating of statistics, it might prevent the Query Optimizer from picking optimal execution plans for queries that involve the table. You should use this option sparingly, and only by a qualified database administrator.

This setting doesn't prevent an automatic update with fullscan of the index-related statistics, during the rebuild operation.

#### ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = { ON | OFF }

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and later versions

Specifies whether row locks are allowed. The default is ON.

- ON

  Row locks are allowed when accessing the index. The [!INCLUDE [ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] determines when row locks are used.

- OFF

  Row locks aren't used.

#### ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = { ON | OFF }

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and later versions

Specifies whether page locks are allowed. The default is ON.

- ON

  Page locks are allowed when accessing the index. The [!INCLUDE [ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] determines when page locks are used.

- OFF

  Page locks aren't used.

#### OPTIMIZE_FOR_SEQUENTIAL_KEY = { ON | OFF }

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [sql-server-2019](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] and later versions

Specifies whether or not to optimize for last-page insert contention. The default is `OFF`. For more information, see the [Sequential keys](create-index-transact-sql.md#sequential-keys) section of the `CREATE INDEX` article.

#### SORT_IN_TEMPDB = { ON | OFF }

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and later versions

Specifies whether to store sort results in `tempdb`. The default is `OFF`.

- ON

  The intermediate sort results that are used to build the index are stored in `tempdb`. This might reduce the time required to create an index if `tempdb` is on a different set of disks than the user database. However, this increases the amount of disk space that is used during the index build.

- OFF

  The intermediate sort results are stored in the same database as the index.

#### ONLINE = { ON | OFF }

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and later versions

Specifies whether underlying tables and associated indexes are available for queries and data modification during the index operation. The default is `OFF`. `REBUILD` can be performed as an `ONLINE` operation.

> [!NOTE]  
> Unique nonclustered indexes can't be created online. This includes indexes that are created due to a `UNIQUE` or `PRIMARY KEY` constraint.

- ON

  Long-term table locks aren't held during the index operation. During the main phase of the index operation, only an Intent Share (IS) lock is held on the source table. This enables queries or updates to the underlying table and indexes to proceed. At the start of the operation, a Shared (S) lock is held on the source object for a short period of time. At the end of the operation, for a short period of time, an S (Shared) lock is acquired on the source if a nonclustered index is being created; or a Sch-M (Schema Modification) lock is acquired when a clustered index is created or dropped online and when a clustered or nonclustered index is being rebuilt. Although the online index locks are short metadata locks, especially the Sch-M lock must wait for all blocking transactions to be completed on this table. During the wait time, the Sch-M lock blocks all other transactions that wait behind this lock when accessing the same table. `ONLINE` can't be set to `ON` when an index is being created on a local temporary table.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Online index rebuild can set the *low_priority_lock_wait* options described later in this section. *low_priority_lock_wait* manages S and Sch-M lock priority during online index rebuild.

- OFF

  Table locks are applied during the index operation. This prevents all user access to the underlying table during the operation. An offline index operation that creates, rebuilds, or drops a clustered index, or rebuilds or drops a nonclustered index, acquires a Schema modification (Sch-M) lock on the table. This prevents all user access to the underlying table during the operation. An offline index operation that creates a nonclustered index acquires a Shared (S) lock on the table. This prevents updates to the underlying table but allows read operations, such as `SELECT` statements.

> [!NOTE]  
> Online index operations aren't available in every edition of [!INCLUDE [msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For a list of features that are supported by the editions of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see [Editions and supported features of SQL Server 2022](../../sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2022.md).

#### RESUMABLE = { ON | OFF}

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] and later versions

Specifies whether an `ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT` operation is resumable. Add table constraint operation is resumable when `ON`. Add table constraint operation isn't resumable when `OFF`. Default is `OFF`. When the `RESUMABLE` option is set to `ON`, the option `ONLINE = ON` is required.

`MAX_DURATION` when used with `RESUMABLE = ON` (requires `ONLINE = ON`) indicates time (an integer value specified in minutes) that a resumable online add constraint operation is executed before being paused. If not specified, the operation continues until completion. `MAXDOP` is supported with `RESUMABLE = ON` as well.

For more information on enabling and using resumable `ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT` operations, see [Resumable add table constraints](../../relational-databases/security/resumable-add-table-constraints.md).

#### MAXDOP = *max_degree_of_parallelism*

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and later versions

Overrides the **max degree of parallelism** configuration option during the index operation. For more information, see [Configure the max degree of parallelism (server configuration option)](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-the-max-degree-of-parallelism-server-configuration-option.md). Use `MAXDOP` to limit the number of processors used in a parallel plan execution. The maximum is 64 processors.

*max_degree_of_parallelism* can be:

- `1`: Suppresses parallel plan generation.
- `>1`: Restricts the maximum number of processors used in a parallel index operation to the specified number.
- `0` (default): Uses the actual number of processors or fewer based on the current system workload.

For more information, see [Configure Parallel Index Operations](../../relational-databases/indexes/configure-parallel-index-operations.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> Parallel index operations aren't available in every edition of [!INCLUDE [msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For a list of features that are supported by the editions of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see [Editions and supported features of SQL Server 2022](../../sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2022.md).

#### DATA_COMPRESSION

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and later versions

Specifies the data compression option for the specified table, partition number, or range of partitions. The options are as follows:

- NONE

  Table or specified partitions aren't compressed. Applies only to rowstore tables; doesn't apply to columnstore tables.

- ROW

  Table or specified partitions are compressed by using row compression. Applies only to rowstore tables; doesn't apply to columnstore tables.

- PAGE

  Table or specified partitions are compressed by using page compression. Applies only to rowstore tables; doesn't apply to columnstore tables.

- COLUMNSTORE

  **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] and later versions

  Applies only to columnstore tables. `COLUMNSTORE` specifies to decompress a partition that was compressed with the `COLUMNSTORE_ARCHIVE` option. When the data is restored, the `COLUMNSTORE` index continues to be compressed with the columnstore compression that is used for all columnstore tables.

- COLUMNSTORE_ARCHIVE

  **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] and later versions

  Applies only to columnstore tables, which are tables stored with a clustered columnstore index. `COLUMNSTORE_ARCHIVE` further compresses the specified partition to a smaller size. This can be used for archival, or for other situations that require less storage and can afford more time for storage and retrieval

For more information about compression, see [Data compression](../../relational-databases/data-compression/data-compression.md).

#### XML_COMPRESSION

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] and later versions, [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)], and [!INCLUDE [ssazuremi](../../includes/ssazuremi-md.md)].

Specifies the XML compression option for any **xml** data type columns in the table. The options are as follows:

- ON

  Columns using the **xml** data type are compressed.

- OFF

  Columns using the **xml** data type aren't compressed.

#### ON PARTITIONS ( { \<partition_number_expression> | \<range> } [ ,...*n* ] )

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and later versions

Specifies the partitions to which the `DATA_COMPRESSION` or `XML_COMPRESSION` settings apply. If the table isn't partitioned, the `ON PARTITIONS` argument generates an error. If the `ON PARTITIONS` clause isn't provided, the `DATA_COMPRESSION` or `XML_COMPRESSION` option applies to all partitions of a partitioned table.

`<partition_number_expression>` can be specified in the following ways:

- Provide the number a partition, for example: `ON PARTITIONS (2)`.
- Provide the partition numbers for several individual partitions separated by commas, for example: `ON PARTITIONS (1, 5)`.
- Provide both ranges and individual partitions, for example: `ON PARTITIONS (2, 4, 6 TO 8)`.

`<range>` can be specified as partition numbers separated by the word TO, for example: `ON PARTITIONS (6 TO 8)`.

To set different types of data compression for different partitions, specify the `DATA_COMPRESSION` option more than once, for example:

```sql
--For rowstore tables
REBUILD WITH
(
  DATA_COMPRESSION = NONE ON PARTITIONS (1),
  DATA_COMPRESSION = ROW ON PARTITIONS (2, 4, 6 TO 8),
  DATA_COMPRESSION = PAGE ON PARTITIONS (3, 5)
)

--For columnstore tables
REBUILD WITH
(
  DATA_COMPRESSION = COLUMNSTORE ON PARTITIONS (1, 3, 5),
  DATA_COMPRESSION = COLUMNSTORE_ARCHIVE ON PARTITIONS (2, 4, 6 TO 8)
)
```

#### \<single_partition_rebuild__option>

In most cases, rebuilding an index also rebuilds all partitions of a partitioned index. The following options, when applied to a single partition, don't rebuild all partitions.

- `SORT_IN_TEMPDB`
- `MAXDOP`
- `DATA_COMPRESSION`
- `XML_COMPRESSION`

#### low_priority_lock_wait

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] and later versions

A `SWITCH` or online index rebuild completes as soon as there are no blocking operations for this table. *WAIT_AT_LOW_PRIORITY* indicates that if the `SWITCH` or online index rebuild operation can't be completed immediately, it waits. The operation holds low priority locks, allowing other operations that hold locks conflicting with the DDL statement to proceed. Omitting the `WAIT AT LOW PRIORITY` option is equivalent to `WAIT_AT_LOW_PRIORITY ( MAX_DURATION = 0 minutes, ABORT_AFTER_WAIT = NONE)`.

#### MAX_DURATION = *time* [ MINUTES ]

The wait time (an integer value specified in minutes) that the `SWITCH` or online index rebuild lock that must be acquired, waits when executing the DDL command. The `SWITCH` or online index rebuild operation attempts to complete immediately. If the operation is blocked for the `MAX_DURATION` time, one of the `ABORT_AFTER_WAIT` actions is executed. `MAX_DURATION` time is always in minutes, and the word `MINUTES` can be omitted.

#### ABORT_AFTER_WAIT = { NONE | SELF | BLOCKERS }

- NONE

  Continues the `SWITCH` or online index rebuild operation without changing the lock priority (using regular priority).

- SELF

  Exits the `SWITCH` or online index rebuild DDL operation currently being executed without taking any action.

- BLOCKERS

  Kills all user transactions that block currently the `SWITCH` or online index rebuild DDL operation so that the operation can continue.

  `BLOCKERS` requires the `ALTER ANY CONNECTION` permission.
