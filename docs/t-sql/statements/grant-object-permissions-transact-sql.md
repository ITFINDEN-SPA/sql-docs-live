## Arguments

#### *permission*  
 Specifies a permission that can be granted on a schema-contained object. For a list of the permissions, see [Remarks](#remarks).
  
#### ALL  
 Granting ALL does not grant all possible permissions. Granting ALL is equivalent to granting all [!INCLUDE [vcpransi](../../includes/vcpransi-md.md)]-92 permissions applicable to the specified object. The meaning of ALL varies as follows:  
  
- Scalar function permissions: EXECUTE, REFERENCES.  
- Table-valued function permissions: DELETE, INSERT, REFERENCES, SELECT, UPDATE.  
- Stored procedure permissions: EXECUTE.  
- Table permissions: DELETE, INSERT, REFERENCES, SELECT, UPDATE.  
- View permissions: DELETE, INSERT, REFERENCES, SELECT, UPDATE.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
> The ALL permission is deprecated and maintained only for compatibility.
  
#### PRIVILEGES  
 Included for [!INCLUDE [vcpransi](../../includes/vcpransi-md.md)]-92 compliance. Does not change the behavior of ALL.  
  
#### *column_name*  
 Specifies the name of a column in a table, view, or table-valued function on which the permission is being granted. The parentheses ( ) are required. Only SELECT, REFERENCES, UPDATE, and UNMASK permissions can be granted on a column. *column_name* can be specified in the permissions clause or after the securable name.  
  
> [!CAUTION]  
> A table-level DENY does not take precedence over a column-level GRANT. This inconsistency in the permissions hierarchy has been preserved for backward compatibility.  
  
#### ON [ OBJECT :: ] [ *schema_name* ] . *object_name*  
 Specifies the object on which the permission is being granted. The OBJECT phrase is optional if *schema_name* is specified. If the OBJECT phrase is used, the scope qualifier (::) is required. If *schema_name* is not specified, the default schema is used. If *schema_name* is specified, the schema scope qualifier (.) is required.  
  
#### TO \<database_principal>  
 Specifies the principal to which the permission is being granted.  
  
#### WITH GRANT OPTION  
 Indicates that the principal will also be given the ability to grant the specified permission to other principals.  
  
#### AS \<database_principal>  
 Specifies a principal from which the principal executing this query derives its right to grant the permission.  
  
 *Database_user*  
 Specifies a database user.  
  
 *Database_role*  
 Specifies a database role.  
  
 *Application_role*  
 Specifies an application role.  
  
 *Database_user_mapped_to_Windows_User*  
 Specifies a database user mapped to a Windows user.  
  
 *Database_user_mapped_to_Windows_Group*  
 Specifies a database user mapped to a Windows group.  
  
 *Database_user_mapped_to_certificate*  
 Specifies a database user mapped to a certificate.  
  
 *Database_user_mapped_to_asymmetric_key*  
 Specifies a database user mapped to an asymmetric key.  
  
 *Database_user_with_no_login*  
 Specifies a database user with no corresponding server-level principal.  
  
## Remarks
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> A combination of `ALTER` and `REFERENCE` permissions in some cases could allow the grantee to view data or execute unauthorized functions. For example: A user with `ALTER` permission on a table and `REFERENCE` permission on a function can create a computed column over a function and have it be executed. In this case the user would also need `SELECT` permission on the computed column.  
  
 Information about objects is visible in various catalog views. For more information, see [Object Catalog Views (Transact-SQL)](../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/object-catalog-views-transact-sql.md).  
  
 An object is a schema-level securable contained by the schema that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be granted on an object are listed in the following table, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Object permission|Implied by object permission|Implied by schema permission|  
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|  
|`ALTER`|`CONTROL`|`ALTER`|
|`CONTROL`|`CONTROL`|`CONTROL`|
|`DELETE`|`CONTROL`|`DELETE`|
|`EXECUTE`|`CONTROL`|`EXECUTE`|
|`INSERT`|`CONTROL`|`INSERT`|
|`RECEIVE`|`CONTROL`|`CONTROL`|
|`REFERENCES`|`CONTROL`|`REFERENCES`|
|`SELECT`|`RECEIVE`|`SELECT`|
|`TAKE OWNERSHIP`|`CONTROL`|`CONTROL`|
|`UPDATE`|`CONTROL`|`UPDATE`|
|`VIEW CHANGE TRACKING`|`CONTROL`|`VIEW CHANGE TRACKING`|
|`VIEW DEFINITION`|`CONTROL`|`VIEW DEFINITION`|
  
## Permissions

 The grantor (or the principal specified with the AS option) must have either the permission itself with `GRANT OPTION`, or a higher permission that implies the permission being granted.  
  
 If you are using the AS option, the following additional requirements apply.  
  
|AS|Additional permission required|  
|--------|------------------------------------|  
|Database user|`IMPERSONATE` permission on the user, membership in the `db_securityadmin` fixed database role, membership in the `db_owner` fixed database role, or membership in the `sysadmin` fixed server role.|  
|Database user mapped to a Windows login|`IMPERSONATE` permission on the user, membership in the `db_securityadmin` fixed database role, membership in the `db_owner` fixed database role, or membership in the `sysadmin` fixed server role.|  
|Database user mapped to a Windows Group|Membership in the Windows group, membership in the `db_securityadmin` fixed database role, membership in the `db_owner` fixed database role, or membership in the `sysadmin` fixed server role.|  
|Database user mapped to a certificate|Membership in the `db_securityadmin` fixed database role, membership in the `db_owner` fixed database role, or membership in the `sysadmin` fixed server role.|  
|Database user mapped to an asymmetric key|Membership in the `db_securityadmin` fixed database role, membership in the `db_owner` fixed database role, or membership in the `sysadmin` fixed server role.|  
|Database user not mapped to any server principal|`IMPERSONATE` permission on the user, membership in the `db_securityadmin` fixed database role, membership in the `db_owner` fixed database role, or membership in the `sysadmin` fixed server role.|  
|Database role|`ALTER` permission on the role, membership in the `db_securityadmin` fixed database role, membership in the `db_owner` fixed database role, or membership in the `sysadmin` fixed server role.|  
|Application role|`ALTER` permission on the role, membership in the `db_securityadmin` fixed database role, membership in the `db_owner` fixed database role, or membership in the `sysadmin` fixed server role.|  
  
## Examples
  
### A. Grant SELECT permission on a table

The following example grants `SELECT` permission to user `RosaQdM` on table `Person.Address` in the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  
  
This example as written does not work in [!INCLUDE [fabric](../../includes/fabric.md)] because it uses a user for a SQL authenticated login, but this same example would work for a Microsoft Entra ID Fabric user, for example, `RosaQdM@contoso.com`.

```sql  
GRANT SELECT ON OBJECT::Person.Address TO RosaQdM;  
GO  
```  
  
### B. Grant EXECUTE permission on a stored procedure

The following example grants `EXECUTE` permission on stored procedure `HumanResources.uspUpdateEmployeeHireInfo` to an application role called `Recruiting11`.
  
```sql  
USE AdventureWorks2022;   
GRANT EXECUTE ON OBJECT::HumanResources.uspUpdateEmployeeHireInfo  
    TO Recruiting11;  
GO   
```  
  
### C. Grant REFERENCES permission on a view with GRANT OPTION

 The following example grants `REFERENCES` permission on column `BusinessEntityID` in view `HumanResources.vEmployee` to user `Wanida` with `GRANT OPTION`.  

This example as written does not work in [!INCLUDE [fabric](../../includes/fabric.md)] because it uses a user for a SQL authenticated login, but this same example would work for a Microsoft Entra ID Fabric user, for example, `Wanida@contoso.com`.
  
```sql  
GRANT REFERENCES (BusinessEntityID) ON OBJECT::HumanResources.vEmployee   
    TO Wanida WITH GRANT OPTION;  
GO  
```  
  
### D. Grant SELECT permission on a table without using the OBJECT phrase

 The following example grants `SELECT` permission to user `RosaQdM` on table `Person.Address` in the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  

This example as written does not work in [!INCLUDE [fabric](../../includes/fabric.md)] because it uses a user for a SQL authenticated login, but this same example would work for a Microsoft Entra ID Fabric user, for example, `RosaQdM@contoso.com`.

```sql  
GRANT SELECT ON Person.Address TO RosaQdM;  
GO  
```  
  
### E. Grant SELECT permission on a table to a domain account

 The following example grants `SELECT` permission to user `AdventureWorks2022\RosaQdM` on table `Person.Address` in the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  

This example as written does not work in [!INCLUDE [fabric](../../includes/fabric.md)] because it uses a domain account, but this same example would work for a Microsoft Entra ID Fabric user, for example, `RosaQdM@contoso.com`.

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON Person.Address TO [AdventureWorks2022\RosaQdM];  
GO  
```  
  
### F. Grant EXECUTE permission on a procedure to a role

 The following example creates a role and then grants `EXECUTE` permission to the role on procedure `uspGetBillOfMaterials` in the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  

```sql  
CREATE ROLE newrole ;  
GRANT EXECUTE ON dbo.uspGetBillOfMaterials TO newrole ;  
GO  
```  

### G. Grant UNMASK permission on a column

 The following example grants the `UNMASK` permission, part of [Dynamic data masking](../../relational-databases/security/dynamic-data-masking.md), for the column `email` in the table `Data.Membership` to user `OutreachCoordinator`.

Dynamic data masking is not currently supported in Microsoft Fabric. <!-- This example as written does not work in [!INCLUDE [fabric](../../includes/fabric.md)] because it uses a user for a SQL authenticated login, but this same example would work for a Microsoft Entra ID Fabric user, for example, `OutreachCoordinator@contoso.com`. -->

```sql
GRANT UNMASK ON OBJECT::Data.Membership (email) to OutreachCoordinator;
GO
```
