# CREATE SECURITY POLICY (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver2016-asdb-asdbmi-fabricse-fabricdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016-asdb-asdbmi-fabricse-fabricdw.md)]

  Creates a security policy for [row-level security](../../relational-databases/security/row-level-security.md).

## Syntax
  
```syntaxsql
CREATE SECURITY POLICY [schema_name. ] security_policy_name    
    { ADD [ FILTER | BLOCK ] } PREDICATE tvf_schema_name.security_predicate_function_name   
      ( { column_name | expression } [ , ...n] ) ON table_schema_name. table_name    
      [ <block_dml_operation> ] , [ , ...n] 
    [ WITH ( STATE = { ON | OFF }  [,] [ SCHEMABINDING = { ON | OFF } ] ) ]  
    [ NOT FOR REPLICATION ] 
[;]  
  
<block_dml_operation>  
    [ { AFTER { INSERT | UPDATE } }   
    | { BEFORE { UPDATE | DELETE } } ]  
```  

## Arguments

#### *security_policy_name*

 The name of the security policy. Security policy names must comply with the rules for identifiers and must be unique within the database and to its schema.  
  
#### *schema_name*

 Is the name of the schema to which the security policy belongs. *schema_name* is required because of schema binding.  
  
#### [ FILTER | BLOCK ]

 The type of security predicate for the function being bound to the target table. `FILTER` predicates silently filter the rows that are available to read operations. `BLOCK` predicates explicitly block write operations that violate the predicate function.  
  
#### *tvf_schema_name.security_predicate_function_name*

 Is the inline table value function that will be used as a predicate and that will be enforced upon queries against a target table. At most one security predicate can be defined for a particular DML operation against a particular table. The inline table value function must have been created using the `SCHEMABINDING` option.  
  
#### { *column_name* | *expression* }

 A column name or expression used as a parameter for the security predicate function. Any column on the target table can be used. An [Expression](../../t-sql/language-elements/expressions-transact-sql.md) can only include constants, built in scalar functions, operators and columns from the target table. A column name or expression needs to be specified for each parameter of the function.  
  
#### *table_schema_name.table_name*

 Is the target table to which the security predicate will be applied. Multiple disabled security policies can target a single table for a particular DML operation, but only one can be enabled at any given time.  
  
#### *block_dml_operation*

 The particular DML operation for which the block predicate will be applied. `AFTER` specifies that the predicate will be evaluated on the values of the rows after the DML operation was performed (`INSERT` or `UPDATE`). `BEFORE` specifies that the predicate will be evaluated on the values of the rows before the DML operation is performed (`UPDATE` or `DELETE`). If no operation is specified, the predicate will apply to all operations.  
  
#### [ STATE = { ON | OFF } ]

 Enables or disables the security policy from enforcing its security predicates against the target tables. If not specified the security policy being created is enabled.  
  
#### [ SCHEMABINDING = { ON | OFF } ]

 Indicates whether all predicate functions in the policy must be created with the `SCHEMABINDING` option. By default this setting is `ON` and all functions must be created with `SCHEMABINDING`.  
  
#### NOT FOR REPLICATION

 Indicates that the security policy should not be executed when a replication agent modifies the target object. For more information, see [Control the Behavior of Triggers and Constraints During Synchronization (Replication Transact-SQL Programming)](../../relational-databases/replication/control-behavior-of-triggers-and-constraints-in-synchronization.md).  
  
#### [ *table_schema_name*. ] *table_name*

 Is the target table to which the security predicate will be applied. Multiple disabled security policies can target a single table, but only one can be enabled at any given time.  
  

## Remarks

 When using predicate functions with memory-optimized tables, you must include `SCHEMABINDING` and use the `WITH NATIVE_COMPILATION` compilation hint.  
  
 Block predicates are evaluated after the corresponding DML operation is executed. Therefore, there is danger that a READ UNCOMMITTED query can see transient values that will be rolled back.  
  
## Permissions

 Requires the ALTER ANY SECURITY POLICY permission and ALTER permission on the schema.  
  
 Additionally the following permissions are required for each predicate that is added:  
  
-   SELECT and REFERENCES permissions on the function being used as a predicate.  
  
-   REFERENCES permission on the target table being bound to the policy.  
  
-   REFERENCES permission on every column from the target table used as arguments.  
  
## Examples

The following examples demonstrate the use of the `CREATE SECURITY POLICY` syntax. For an example of a complete security policy scenario, see [Row-level security](../../relational-databases/security/row-level-security.md).
  
### A. Create a security policy

 The following syntax creates a security policy with a filter predicate for the `dbo.Customer` table, and leaves the security policy disabled.  
  
```sql
CREATE SECURITY POLICY [FederatedSecurityPolicy]   
ADD FILTER PREDICATE [rls].[fn_securitypredicate]([CustomerId])   
ON [dbo].[Customer];  
```  
  
### B. Create a policy that affects multiple tables


 The following syntax creates a security policy with three filter predicates on three different tables, and enables the security policy.  
  
```sql  
CREATE SECURITY POLICY [FederatedSecurityPolicy]   
ADD FILTER PREDICATE [rls].[fn_securitypredicate1]([CustomerId])   
    ON [dbo].[Customer],  
ADD FILTER PREDICATE [rls].[fn_securitypredicate1]([VendorId])   
    ON [dbo].[ Vendor],  
ADD FILTER PREDICATE [rls].[fn_securitypredicate2]([WingId])   
    ON [dbo].[Patient]  
WITH (STATE = ON);  
```  
  
### C. Create a policy with multiple types of security predicates

 Adding both a filter predicate and a block predicate to the `dbo.Sales` table.  
  
```sql  
CREATE SECURITY POLICY rls.SecPol  
    ADD FILTER PREDICATE rls.tenantAccessPredicate(TenantId) ON dbo.Sales,  
    ADD BLOCK PREDICATE rls.tenantAccessPredicate(TenantId) ON dbo.Sales AFTER INSERT;  
```
