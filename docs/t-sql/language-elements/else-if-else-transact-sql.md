# ELSE (IF...ELSE) (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw.md)]

Imposes conditions on the execution of a [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement. The [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement (*sql_statement*) following the *boolean_expression* is executed if the *boolean_expression* evaluates to `TRUE`. The optional `ELSE` keyword is an alternate [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement that is executed when *boolean_expression* evaluates to `FALSE` or `NULL`.

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
IF boolean_expression
    { sql_statement | statement_block }
[ ELSE
    { sql_statement | statement_block } ]
```

[!INCLUDE [sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments

#### *boolean_expression*

An expression that returns `TRUE` or `FALSE`. If the *boolean_expression* contains a `SELECT` statement, the `SELECT` statement must be enclosed in parentheses.

#### { *sql_statement* | *statement_block* }

Any valid [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement or statement grouping as defined with a statement block. To define a statement block (batch), use the control-of-flow language keywords `BEGIN` and `END`. Although all [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements are valid within a `BEGIN...END` block, certain [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements shouldn't be grouped together within the same batch (statement block).

## Return types

**Boolean**

## Examples

[!INCLUDE [article-uses-adventureworks](../../includes/article-uses-adventureworks.md)]

### A. Use a Boolean expression

The following example has a Boolean expression (`1 = 1`) that is true and, therefore, prints the first statement.

```sql
IF 1 = 1 PRINT 'Boolean expression is true.'
ELSE PRINT 'Boolean expression is false.';
```

The following example has a Boolean expression (`1 = 2`) that is false, and therefore prints the second statement.

```sql
IF 1 = 2 PRINT 'Boolean expression is true.'
ELSE PRINT 'Boolean expression is false.';
GO
```

### B. Use a query as part of a Boolean expression

The following example executes a query as part of the Boolean expression. Because there are 10 bikes in the `Product` table that meet the condition in the `WHERE` clause, the first print statement executes. You can change `> 5` to `> 15`, to see how the second part of the statement could execute.

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO

IF (SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM Production.Product
    WHERE Name LIKE 'Touring-3000%'
) > 5
    PRINT 'There are more than 5 Touring-3000 bicycles.'
ELSE
    PRINT 'There are 5 or less Touring-3000 bicycles.';
GO
```

### C. Use a statement block

The following example executes a query as part of the Boolean expression and then executes slightly different statement blocks based on the result of the Boolean expression. Each statement block starts with `BEGIN` and completes with `END`.

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO

DECLARE @AvgWeight DECIMAL(8, 2),
    @BikeCount INT

IF (
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM Production.Product
    WHERE Name LIKE 'Touring-3000%'
) > 5
BEGIN
    SET @BikeCount = (
            SELECT COUNT(*)
            FROM Production.Product
            WHERE Name LIKE 'Touring-3000%'
    );
    SET @AvgWeight = (
            SELECT AVG(Weight)
            FROM Production.Product
            WHERE Name LIKE 'Touring-3000%'
    );

    PRINT 'There are ' + CAST(@BikeCount AS VARCHAR(3)) + ' Touring-3000 bikes.'
    PRINT 'The average weight of the top 5 Touring-3000 bikes is ' + CAST(@AvgWeight AS VARCHAR(8)) + '.';
END
ELSE
BEGIN
    SET @AvgWeight = (
            SELECT AVG(Weight)
            FROM Production.Product
            WHERE Name LIKE 'Touring-3000%'
    );

    PRINT 'Average weight of the Touring-3000 bikes is ' + CAST(@AvgWeight AS VARCHAR(8)) + '.';
END;
GO
```

### D. Use nested IF...ELSE statements

The following example shows how an `IF...ELSE` statement can be nested inside another. Set the `@Number` variable to `5`, `50`, and `500`, to test each statement.

```sql
DECLARE @Number INT;
SET @Number = 50;

IF @Number > 100
    PRINT 'The number is large.';
ELSE
BEGIN
    IF @Number < 10
        PRINT 'The number is small.';
    ELSE
        PRINT 'The number is medium.';
END;
GO
```

## Examples: [!INCLUDE [ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)]

### E: Using a query as part of a Boolean expression

The following example uses `IF...ELSE` to determine which of two responses to show the user, based on the weight of an item in the `DimProduct` table in the `AdventureWorksDW2012` database.

```sql
DECLARE @maxWeight FLOAT, @productKey INT;

SET @maxWeight = 100.00;
SET @productKey = 424;

IF @maxWeight <= (
    SELECT [Weight]
    FROM DimProduct
    WHERE ProductKey = @productKey;
)
BEGIN
    SELECT @productKey,
        EnglishDescription,
        [Weight],
        'This product is too heavy to ship and is only available for pickup.'
    FROM DimProduct
    WHERE ProductKey = @productKey;
END
ELSE
BEGIN
    SELECT @productKey,
        EnglishDescription,
        [Weight],
        'This product is available for shipping or pickup.'
    FROM DimProduct
    WHERE ProductKey = @productKey;
END
```
