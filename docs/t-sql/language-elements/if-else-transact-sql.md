# IF...ELSE (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw.md)]

Imposes conditions on the execution of a [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement. The [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement that follows an `IF` keyword and its condition is executed if the condition is satisfied: the Boolean expression returns `TRUE`. The optional `ELSE` keyword introduces another [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement that is executed when the `IF` condition isn't satisfied: the Boolean expression returns `FALSE`.

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
IF boolean_expression
    { sql_statement | statement_block }
[ ELSE
    { sql_statement | statement_block } ]
```

[!INCLUDE [sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments

#### *boolean_expression*

An expression that returns `TRUE` or `FALSE`. If the Boolean expression contains a `SELECT` statement, the `SELECT` statement must be enclosed in parentheses.

#### { *sql_statement* | *statement_block* }

Any [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement or statement grouping as defined by using a statement block. Unless a statement block is used, the `IF` or `ELSE` condition can affect the performance of only one [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement.

To define a statement block, use the control-of-flow keywords `BEGIN` and `END`.

## Remarks

An `IF...ELSE` construct can be used in batches, in stored procedures, and in ad hoc queries. When this construct is used in a stored procedure, it's usually to test for the existence of some parameter.

`IF` tests can be nested after another `IF` or following an `ELSE`. The limit to the number of nested levels depends on available memory.

## Examples

```sql
IF DATENAME(weekday, GETDATE()) IN (N'Saturday', N'Sunday')
    SELECT 'Weekend';
ELSE
    SELECT 'Weekday';
```

For more examples, see [ELSE (IF...ELSE)](else-if-else-transact-sql.md).

## Examples: [!INCLUDE [ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)]

The following example uses `IF...ELSE` to determine which of two responses to show the user, based on the weight of an item in the `DimProduct` table.

```sql
-- Uses AdventureWorksDW

DECLARE @maxWeight FLOAT, @productKey INT;

SET @maxWeight = 100.00;
SET @productKey = 424;

IF @maxWeight <= (
        SELECT Weight
        FROM DimProduct
        WHERE ProductKey = @productKey
    )
    SELECT @productKey AS ProductKey,
        EnglishDescription,
        Weight,
        'This product is too heavy to ship and is only available for pickup.' AS ShippingStatus
    FROM DimProduct
    WHERE ProductKey = @productKey;
ELSE
    SELECT @productKey AS ProductKey,
        EnglishDescription,
        Weight,
        'This product is available for shipping or pickup.' AS ShippingStatus
    FROM DimProduct
    WHERE ProductKey = @productKey;
```
