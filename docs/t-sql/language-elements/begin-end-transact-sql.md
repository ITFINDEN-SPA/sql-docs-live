# BEGIN...END (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw.md)]

Encloses a series of [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements so that a group of [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements can be executed in a logical block of code. `BEGIN` and `END` are control-of-flow language keywords.

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
BEGIN
    { sql_statement | statement_block }
END
```

[!INCLUDE [sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments

#### { *sql_statement* | *statement_block* }

Any valid [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement or statement grouping as defined by using a statement block.

## Remarks

`BEGIN...END` blocks can be nested.

Although all [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements are valid within a `BEGIN...END` block, certain [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements shouldn't be grouped together within the same batch, or statement block.

## Examples

In the following example, `BEGIN` and `END` define a series of [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements that execute together. If the `BEGIN...END` block isn't included, both `ROLLBACK TRANSACTION` statements would execute, and both `PRINT` messages would be returned.

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO

BEGIN TRANSACTION
GO

IF @@TRANCOUNT = 0
BEGIN
    SELECT FirstName, MiddleName
    FROM Person.Person
    WHERE LastName = 'Adams';

    ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;

    PRINT N'Rolling back the transaction two times would cause an error.';
END;

ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;

PRINT N'Rolled back the transaction.';
GO
```

## Examples: [!INCLUDE [ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)]

In the following example, `BEGIN` and `END` define a series of [!INCLUDE [DWsql](../../includes/dwsql-md.md)] statements that run together. If the `BEGIN...END` block isn't included, the following example runs in a continuous loop.

```sql
-- Uses AdventureWorksDW

DECLARE @Iteration INT = 0;

WHILE @Iteration < 10
BEGIN
    SELECT FirstName,
        MiddleName
    FROM dbo.DimCustomer
    WHERE LastName = 'Adams';

    SET @Iteration += 1;
END;
```
