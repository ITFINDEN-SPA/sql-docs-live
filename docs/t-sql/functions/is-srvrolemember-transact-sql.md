# IS_SRVROLEMEMBER (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  Indicates whether a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login is a member of the specified server role.  
  
 :::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
IS_SRVROLEMEMBER ( 'role' [ , 'login' ] )  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 **'** *role* **'**  
 Is the name of the server role that is being checked. *role* is **sysname**.  
  
 Valid values for *role* are user-defined server roles, and the following fixed server roles:  

- sysadmin
- serveradmin
- dbcreator
- setupadmin  
- bulkadmin
- securityadmin  
- diskadmin
- public  
- processadmin
  
 **'** *login* **'**  
 Is the name of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login to check. *login* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL. If no value is specified, the result is based on the current Execution context. If the parameter contains the word NULL, it returns NULL.

> [!NOTE]
> While Microsoft Entra logins are in public preview for Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse, using a Microsoft Entra principal for *login* is not supported.

## Return Types  
 **int**  
  
|Return value|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|  
|0|*login* isn't a member of *role*.<br /><br /> In [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)], this statement always returns 0.|  
|1|*login* is a member of *role*.|  
|NULL|*role* or *login* isn't valid, or you don't have permission to view the role membership.|  
  
## Remarks  
 Use IS_SRVROLEMEMBER to determine whether the current user can perform an action requiring the server role's permissions.  
  
 If a Windows login, such as Contoso\Mary5, is specified for *login*, **IS_SRVROLEMEMBER** returns **NULL**, unless the login has been granted or denied direct access to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 If the optional *login* parameter isn't provided and if *login* is a Windows domain login, it may be a member of a fixed server role through membership in a Windows group. To resolve such indirect memberships, IS_SRVROLEMEMBER requests Windows group membership information from the domain controller. If the domain controller is inaccessible or doesn't respond, **IS_SRVROLEMEMBER** returns role membership information by accounting for the user and its local groups only. If the user specified isn't the current user, the value returned by IS_SRVROLEMEMBER might differ from the authenticator's (such as Active Directory) last data update to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 If the optional login parameter is provided, the Windows login that is being queried must be present in sys.server_principals, or IS_SRVROLEMEMBER returns NULL. This indicates that the login isn't valid.  
  
 When the login parameter is a domain login or based on a Windows group and the domain controller is inaccessible, calls to IS_SRVROLEMEMBER will fail and might return incorrect or incomplete data.  
  
 If the domain controller isn't available, the call to IS_SRVROLEMEMBER returns accurate information when the Windows principal can be authenticated locally, such as a local Windows account or a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login.  
  
 **IS_SRVROLEMEMBER** always returns 0 when a Windows group is used as the login argument, and this Windows group is a member of another Windows group which is, in turn, a member of the specified server role.  
  
 The User Account Control (UAC) setting might also cause the return different results. This would depend on whether the user accessed the server as a Windows group member or as a specific [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] user.  
  
 This function evaluates role membership, not the underlying permission. For example, the **sysadmin** fixed server role has the **CONTROL SERVER** permission. If the user has the **CONTROL SERVER** permission but isn't a member of the role, this function will correctly report that the user isn't a member of the **sysadmin** role, even though the user has the same permissions.  
  
## Related Functions  
 To determine whether the current user is a member of the specified Windows group, Microsoft Entra group, or [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database role, use [IS_MEMBER &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/functions/is-member-transact-sql.md). To determine whether a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login is a member of a database role, use [IS_ROLEMEMBER &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/functions/is-rolemember-transact-sql.md).
  
## Permissions  
 Requires VIEW DEFINITION permission on the server role.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example indicates whether the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login for the current user is a member of the `sysadmin` fixed server role.  
  
```sql  
IF IS_SRVROLEMEMBER ('sysadmin') = 1  
   print 'Current user''s login is a member of the sysadmin role'  
ELSE IF IS_SRVROLEMEMBER ('sysadmin') = 0  
   print 'Current user''s login is NOT a member of the sysadmin role'  
ELSE IF IS_SRVROLEMEMBER ('sysadmin') IS NULL  
   print 'ERROR: The server role specified is not valid.';  
```  
  
 The following example indicates whether the domain login Pat is a member of the **diskadmin** fixed server role.  
  
```sql  
SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER('diskadmin', 'Contoso\Pat');  
```
