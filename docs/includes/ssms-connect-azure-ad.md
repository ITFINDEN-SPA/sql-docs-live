> In December 2021, releases of SSMS prior to 18.6 will no longer authenticate to Database Engines through Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA).
> To continue utilizing MFA, you need [SSMS 18.6 or later](../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md).
>
> Connectivity to Azure Analysis Services through Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication requires [SSMS 18.5.1 or later](../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md).
