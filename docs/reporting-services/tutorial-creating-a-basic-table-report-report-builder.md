:::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-basic-table-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sample table report prepared in this tutorial that shows product sales data." lightbox="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-basic-table-report-large.png":::
  
## Prerequisites  

For more information about requirements, see [Prerequisites for tutorials (Report Builder)](../reporting-services/prerequisites-for-tutorials-report-builder.md).  
  
## Create report with Table or Matrix Wizard

You can create a table report by using the **Table or Matrix** wizard. The wizard has two design modes: _Report_ and _Shared dataset_. In Report design mode, you specify data in the **Report Data** pane and configure the report layout on the design surface. In Shared dataset design mode, you create dataset queries to share with others. In this tutorial, you use Report design mode.

Start the wizard and create a basic table report:

1. [Start Report Builder](../reporting-services/report-builder/start-report-builder.md) from your computer, the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion_md](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] web portal, or SharePoint integrated mode.  
  
   The **New Report or Dataset** dialog opens. If the dialog doesn't open, select **File** > **New**.  
  
1. Select the **New Report** tab, and select **Table or Matrix Wizard** on the right pane:

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-open-wizard.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to select New Report in the Table or Matrix Wizard.":::
  
### Specify data connection 

A data connection contains the information to connect to an external data source such as a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database. Usually, you get the connection information and the type of credentials to use from the data source owner. To specify a data connection, you can use a shared data source from the report server or create an embedded data source used only in this report.  
  
In this tutorial, you use an embedded data source. To learn more about using a shared data source, see [Alternative ways to get a data connection (Report Builder)](../reporting-services/alternative-ways-to-get-a-data-connection-report-builder.md).  
  
Create an embedded data source for the data connection:
  
1. On the **Choose a dataset** page, select the **Create a dataset** option, and then select **Next**. 
  
1. On the **Choose a connection to a data source** page, select **New**.
  
1. On the **Data Source Properties** dialog, set the following properties on the **General** tab:

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-data-source-general.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to configure General options on the Data Source Properties dialog.":::

   1. Set the **Name** property of the data source to _Product\_Sales_.  
  
   1. For the **Select a connection type** property, confirm **Microsoft SQL Server** is selected.  
  
   1. For the **Connection string** property, enter the following value, where `<servername>` is the name of an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]:  
  
      ```sql
      Data Source=<servername>  
      ```

      Because you use a query that contains the data instead of retrieving the data from a database, the connection string doesn't include the database name. For more information, see [Prerequisites for tutorials (Report Builder)](../reporting-services/prerequisites-for-tutorials-report-builder.md).  
  
1. Switch to the **Credentials** tab, and select your preferred access method for the data source. Enter credentials, as needed:

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-data-source-credentials.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to configure Credentials options on the Data Source Properties dialog.":::
  
1. On the **General** tab, select **Test Connection** to verify you can connect to the data source.

   You should see a popup message: "Connection created successfully." Select **OK** to clear the popup message.

1. To complete the data source setup, select **OK**.

1. To continue in the wizard, select **Next**.
  
### Create query

In a report, you can use a shared dataset that has a predefined query, or you can create an embedded dataset for use only in this specific report. In this tutorial, you create an embedded dataset.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> In the tutorial example, the query contains the data values, so it doesn't need an external data source. This approach makes the query quite long, but it's useful for learning purposes. In a standard business environment, the query doesn't contain the data values.

Create a query by following these steps: 
  
1. On the **Design a query** page, the relational query designer is open. For this tutorial, you use the text-based query designer:

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-design-query.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Design a query page in the Table or Matrix Wizard.":::

1. Select **Edit As Text**. The text-based query designer displays a query pane and a results pane.
  
1. Paste the following [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] query into the top field:
  
   ```sql
   SELECT CAST('2009-01-05' AS date) as SalesDate, 'Accessories' as Subcategory,   
      'Carrying Case' as Product, CAST(9924.60 AS money) AS Sales, 68 as Quantity  
   UNION SELECT CAST('2009-01-06' AS date) as SalesDate, 'Accessories' as Subcategory,  
      'Tripod' as Product, CAST(1350.00 AS money) AS Sales, 18 as Quantity  
   UNION SELECT CAST('2009-01-11' AS date) as SalesDate, 'Accessories' as Subcategory,  
      'Lens Adapter' as Product, CAST(1147.50 AS money) AS Sales, 17 as Quantity  
   UNION SELECT CAST('2009-01-05' AS date) as SalesDate, 'Accessories' as Subcategory,  
      'Mini Battery Charger' as Product, CAST(1056.00 AS money) AS Sales, 44 as Quantity  
   UNION SELECT CAST('2009-01-06' AS date) as SalesDate,  'Accessories' as Subcategory,  
      'Telephoto Conversion Lens' as Product, CAST(1380.00 AS money) AS Sales, 18 as Quantity  
   UNION SELECT CAST('2009-01-06' AS date) as SalesDate,'Accessories' as Subcategory,   
      'USB Cable' as Product, CAST(780.00 AS money) AS Sales, 26 as Quantity  
   UNION SELECT CAST('2009-01-08' AS date) as SalesDate, 'Accessories' as Subcategory,   
      'Budget Movie-Maker' as Product, CAST(3798.00 AS money) AS Sales, 9 as Quantity  
   UNION SELECT CAST('2009-01-09' AS date) as SalesDate, 'Camcorders' as Subcategory,   
      'Business Videographer' as Product, CAST(10400.00 AS money) AS Sales, 13 as Quantity  
   UNION SELECT CAST('2009-01-10' AS date) as SalesDate, 'Camcorders' as Subcategory,   
      'Social Videographer' as Product, CAST(3000.00 AS money) AS Sales, 60 as Quantity  
   UNION SELECT CAST('2009-01-11' AS date) as SalesDate,  'Digital' as Subcategory,   
      'Advanced Digital' as Product, CAST(7234.50 AS money) AS Sales, 39 as Quantity  
   UNION SELECT CAST('2009-01-07' AS date) as SalesDate,  'Digital' as Subcategory,   
      'Compact Digital' as Product, CAST(10836.00 AS money) AS Sales, 84 as Quantity  
   UNION SELECT CAST('2009-01-08' AS date) as SalesDate,  'Digital' as Subcategory,   
      'Consumer Digital' as Product, CAST(2550.00 AS money) AS Sales, 17 as Quantity  
   UNION SELECT CAST('2009-01-05' AS date) as SalesDate, 'Digital' as Subcategory,   
      'Slim Digital' as Product, CAST(8357.80 AS money) AS Sales, 44 as Quantity  
   UNION SELECT CAST('2009-01-09' AS date) as SalesDate, 'Digital SLR' as Subcategory,   
      'SLR Camera 35mm' as Product, CAST(18530.00 AS money) AS Sales, 34 as Quantity  
   UNION SELECT CAST('2009-01-07' AS date) as SalesDate, 'Digital SLR' as Subcategory,   
      'SLR Camera' as Product, CAST(26576.00 AS money) AS Sales, 88 as Quantity
   ```
   
1. On the query designer toolbar, select **Run** (**!**):

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-run-query.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to Run the query to check the result set.":::
  
   The query runs and displays the result set for the fields SalesDate, Subcategory, Product, Sales, and Quantity.  
  
   In the result set, the column headings are based on the names in the query. In the dataset, the column headings become the field names, and are saved in the report. After you complete the wizard, you can use the **Report Data** pane to view the collection of dataset fields.  
  
1. To continue in the wizard, select **Next**.

### Organize data into groups

When you select data fields to form groups, you design a table that has rows and columns that display detail data and aggregated data. In the following procedure, the first two steps specify the data values to display in the table and the last two steps organize the values. 
  
Organize table data into groups on the **Arrange fields** page: 
  
1. From the **Available fields** box, drag the Product field and then the Quantity field to the **Values** box. Position the Quantity field after the Product field.  
  
   The Sum function automatically aggregates the Quantity data, which is the default aggregate for numeric fields. The value is [Sum(Quantity)].  
  
   > [!TIP]
   > You can select the dropdown arrow next to the [Sum(Quantity)] aggregate to view the other aggregate functions. For this exercise, leave the aggregate function set to **Sum**.  
  
1. Drag the Sales field to the **Values** box and position it after the [Sum(Quantity)] aggregate.  
  
   The Sum function aggregates the Sales data. The value is [Sum(Sales)]. 
  
1. Drag the SalesDate field and then the Subcategory field to the **Row groups** box. Position the Subcategory field after the SalesDate field.

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-arrange-fields.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to arrange the table data fields.":::

1. To continue in the wizard, select **Next**. 

### Add subtotal and total rows

After you create groups, you can add and format rows on which to display aggregate values for the fields. You can choose whether to show all the data or to allow the user to expand and collapse grouped data interactively.  
  
Follow these steps to add subtotals and totals for the table data:
  
1. On the **Choose the layout** page, under **Options**, configure the following options:

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-choose-layout.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to choose the layout options for the table.":::

   1. Select the **Show subtotals and grand totals** option.  
  
   1. Select the **Blocked, subtotal below** option.

   1. Clear the **Expand/collapse groups** option.
   
      In this tutorial, the report you create doesn't use the drilldown feature that lets users expand a parent group hierarchy and display child group rows and detail rows. 

1. Select **Next** to check the table in the **Preview** pane. You should see five rows that demonstrate the table layout when you run the report:

   - The first row repeats once for the table to show the column headings.

   - The second row repeats once for each line item in the sales order to show the product name, order quantity, and line total.

   - The third row repeats once for each sales order category to show subtotals per category.

   - The fourth row repeats once for each order date to show the subtotals per day.

   - The fifth row repeats once for the table to show the grand totals.
  
1. Select **Finish**.  
  
   **Report Builder** adds your table to the design surface. The table has five columns and five rows. The **Row Groups** pane shows three row groups: SalesDate, Subcategory, and Details. Detail data is all the data that the dataset query retrieves.  

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-design-surface-new-table.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot of the new table report open on the design surface in Report Builder." lightbox="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-design-surface-new-table.png":::

The wizard process is complete, and you now have a table report with sample data. In the following sections, you format specific table data to display values in a form that's useful for the reader.

## Format table data

**Report Builder** displays table data values in the report by using default formats, such as numbers, dates, times, and so on. You can use the formatting features on the **Home** tab to change how table data displays.  

It can be helpful to format monetary values in the local currency rather than as general numbers. Another scenario is for table data that summarizes changes in value over a short period of short time. It can be more useful to display the data only in minutes or hours, and not also show the month, day, and year.

The following sections demonstrate how to use the formatting features to change how table date displays in the report. The formatted text boxes and placeholder text are shown as sample values in **Design View**.

### Show currency values

By default, the summary data for the Sales field displays as a general number in the table report. The value can be more properly expressed by applying the currency format.   

Follow these steps to format table data as currency:

1. In **Report Builder**, select the Sales column header in your table report:

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-select-sales-header.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to select the Sales column header in the open table report in Report Builder.":::

1. On the **Home** tab, in the **Number** group, select **Placeholder Styles** (**[123]**), and then select **Sample Values**:

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-select-sample-values.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to select the Sample Values option for placeholders in Report Builder.":::
  
1. In your table report, in the Sales column, multi-select the four cells that contain the `[Sum(Sales)]` value.
  
1. On the **Home** tab, in the **Number** group, select **Currency** (**$**). The selected cells change to show the data values by using the currency format.  

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-currency-format.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to change the format for the selected table cells to display as currency.":::

   If your regional setting is English (United States), the default sample text shows the value in dollars `[$12,345.00]`.
   
   If you don't see an example currency value, check the placeholder style for the cells. On the **Home** tab, in the **Number** group, confirm the **Placeholder Styles** (**[123]**) option is set to **Sample Values**.  
  
1. On the **Home** tab, select **Run** to preview your report.

   Confirm the summary values in the Sales column display as currency. Here's an example from the report:

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-sales-currency.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a portion of the table report where the Sales data is shown as currency values rather than general numbers.":::

### Show dates (month, day, year)

By default, the SalesDate field displays both date (month, day, year) and time (hour, minute, second) data. You can change the format of these values to show only the date.
  
Format the values to display the date only:
  
1. On the **Run** tab, select **Design** to return to design view.  

1. In your table report, select the cell that contains the `[SalesDate]` value.  
  
1. On the **Home** tab, in the **Number** group, expand the **Format** dropdown menu, and select **Date**:  

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-date-format.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to change the format for the selected table cell to display as date only.":::

   The cell displays the example date `[1/31/2000]`.
   
   If you don't see an example date value, check the placeholder style. On the **Home** tab, in the **Number** group, confirm the **Placeholder Styles** (**[123]**) option is set to **Sample Values**.    
  
1. On the **Home** tab, select **Run** to preview your report.

   Confirm the values in the SalesDate column display as dates (month, day, year) only. Here's an example from the report:

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-date-only.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a portion of the table report where only the date is displayed and no time value.":::

### Use custom date formats  
  
You can also specify a custom format for a specific field in the table:

1. On the **Run** tab, select **Design** to return to design view.  
  
1. In your table report, go to the cell that previously contained the `[SalesDate]` value.  

1. Right-click the cell and select **Text Box Properties**:

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-open-text-properties.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to open the Text Box Properties dialog for the selected cell."::: 
  
1. In the **Text Box Properties** dialog, configure the cell formatting:

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-text-properties.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to change the format for the selected table cell to a custom format by using the Text Box Properties.":::

   1. In the tab pane, select **Number**.

   1. In the **Category** list, select **Date**.
   
   1. In the **Type** list, select **January 31, 2000**.
   
      The **Sample** section shows a preview of your formatting configuration.

   1. Select **OK** to apply your custom formatting.
  
   The table cell updates to display the example date `[January 31, 2000]`.  
  
1. On the **Home** tab, select **Run** to preview your report.

   Confirm the values in the SalesDate column display the month name rather than the month number. Here's an example from the report:

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-month-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a portion of the table report where the date is shown with the month name of January rather than the month number 1.":::

## Format the table

In addition to applying specific formats to the data in your table, you can also configure attributes of the entire, such as column width, row height, and the table title. The following sections demonstrate these procedures.

### Change column width

By default, each cell in a table contains a text box. A text box expands vertically to accommodate the text when the page is rendered. In the rendered report, each row expands to the height of the tallest rendered text box in the row. The height of the row on the design surface has no effect on the height of the row in the rendered report.  
  
To reduce the amount of vertical space for each row, you can expand the column width to accommodate the expected contents of the text boxes in the column on a single line.  
  
Follow these steps to change the width of the table columns:
  
1. On the **Run** tab, select **Design** to return to design view.  
  
1. On the design surface, select in your table to display the row and column _handles_. The handles appear as gray bars along the edges of the table.  

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-display-handles.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the row and column handles for a table on the design surface in Report Builder.":::

1. Hold and drag the handles to increase the table width.

   > [!TIP]
   > You can expand the width of the design surface to increase the visible area for working on your table. When the table is wider than the design surface, you need to use scroll bars to view the full table.

1. Point to the line between the Subcategory and Product columns to display the double arrow cursor. :::image type="icon" source="../reporting-services/media/double-arrow-icon.png":::

1. Select and drag the line to increase the width for the Product column. Increase the width so product names in the column display on a single line in the rendered report.
  
1. On the **Home** tab, select **Run** to preview your report.

   Confirm the values in the Product column display on a single line. Here's an example from the report:

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-wide-category.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a portion of the table report where the width of the Product column is increased to allow product names to display on a single line.":::

### Customize report title

A report title appears at the top of the report. You can place the report title in a report header. If the report doesn't use a header, you can place the title in a text box at the top of the report body. In this tutorial, you use the text box that is automatically placed at the top of the report body.
  
There are many ways you can customize the report title, such as using different font style, text sizes, and colors. Portions of the title and even individual characters can use separate formatting. For more information, see [Format text in a text box in paginated reports (Report Builder)](../reporting-services/report-design/format-text-in-a-text-box-report-builder-and-ssrs.md).  
  
Follow these steps to customize your report title:
  
1. On the **Run** tab, select **Design** to return to design view.  

1. On the design surface, select the **Click to add title** text box:

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-add-title.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to select the Click to add title text box on the design surface.":::

1. In the **Click to add title** text box, enter the text _Product Sales_, and then select outside the text box.
  
1. Right-click the text box and select **Text Box Properties**.  

1. In the **Text Box Properties** dialog, configure the text formatting:

   1. In the tab pane, select **Font**.

   1. In the **Font** list, select **Arial**.
   
   1. In the **Size** list, select **18pt**.

   1. In the **Color** list, select **Blue**.

   1. For the **Style**, select **Bold**. 
   
      The **Sample** section shows a preview of your formatting configuration.

   1. Select **OK** to apply the title formatting.

1. On the **Home** tab, select **Run** to preview your report.

   Confirm the table shows the updated title:

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-custom-title.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the updated title for the table report.":::

## Save the report

Save the report to a report server or your computer. If you don't save the report to the report server, many [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] features such as subreports aren't available.  
  
Follow these steps to save the report on a report server:
  
1. Select **File** > **Save As**.  
  
1. In the **Save As Report** dialog, select **Recent Sites and Servers** in the right pane.  
  
1. Select or enter the name of the report server where you have permission to save reports.  
  
   The message "Connecting to report server" appears. When the connection completes, the default report folder opens. The report server administrator specifies the default folder location.
  
1. For the report **Name**, replace the default value _Untitled_ with _Product_Sales_.  
  
1. Select **Save**.  
  
The report is saved to the report server. The status bar at the bottom of the window shows the name of the report server that you're connected to.  
  
### Save the report on your computer

You can also save the report on your computer:
  
1. Select **File** > **Save As**.  
  
1. Select **Desktop**, **My Documents**, or **My computer**, and browse to the folder where you want to save the report.  
  
1. For the report **Name**, replace the default value _Untitled_ with _Product_Sales_.  
  
1. Select **Save**.  
  
## Export the report

Reports can be exported to different formats, such as Microsoft Excel and comma separated value (CSV) files. For more information, see [Export paginated reports (Report Builder)](../reporting-services/report-builder/export-reports-report-builder-and-ssrs.md).  
  
In this tutorial, you export the report to Excel and set a property on the report to provide a custom name for the workbook tab.  

### Set Excel workbook tab name

Follow these steps to specify the Excel workbook tab name:
  
1. Select **Design** to return to design view.

1. Select the **View** tab, and select **Properties** to expose the **Properties** pane.
  
1. Select anywhere on the design surface, but outside the table report.

   The items listed in the **Properties** pane correspond to where you select on the design surface. For this procedure, you want to select outside the report area.
  
1. In the **Properties** pane, expand the **Other** group, and locate the **InitialPageName** property.

   > [!TIP]  
   > If you don't see a property in the **Properties** pane, select **Alphabetical** at the top of the pane to order all properties alphabetically.  

1. For the **InitialPageName** property, enter the workbook tab name _Product Sales Excel_.  

   :::image type="content" source="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-initial-page-name.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to set the Initial Page Name for the table report in the Properties pane." lightbox="../reporting-services/media/ssrs-tutorial-custom-title.png" :::

### Export your report to Excel
