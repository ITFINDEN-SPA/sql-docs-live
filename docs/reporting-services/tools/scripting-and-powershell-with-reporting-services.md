# Scripting and PowerShell with Reporting Services
  [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] supports a wide range of development and management scenarios through script. These scenarios include the rs.exe command line utility and PowerShell cmdlets for SharePoint mode report servers. You can also use the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] object model from PowerShell for both Native and SharePoint mode.  
  
-   Administrators can write script in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[visual-basic](../../includes/visual-basic-md.md)] to automate how they deploy and manage a report server installation. Administrators can also generate and run [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] scripts that create, configure, and update a report server database. Administrators can also use the record and playback script features in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] to automate routine maintenance tasks.  
  
-   Developers can create custom applications that include script. You can run script that makes calls to the Report Server Web service. Almost any operation that you can write in managed code can also be written in script.  

- The `RS.exe` utility, a script host running on the report server, processes [!INCLUDE[msCoName] (../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[visual-basic](../../includes/visual-basic-md.md)] .NET script as the supported script language in [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)].
