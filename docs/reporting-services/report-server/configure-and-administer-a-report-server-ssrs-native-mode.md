# Configure and administer a report server (SSRS native mode)
  This article summarizes the approaches that you can use to configure [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]. It also includes a list of articles that explain how to configure specific components, features, or server capabilities. To configure [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], you can:  
  
-   Use the Report Server Configuration Manager. Many of the articles in this section contain information about how to configure specific features through this tool.  
  
-   Use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] to customize server properties, enable My Reports, enable trace logs, and set site-wide defaults. For more information about site settings, see [Reporting Services report server &#40;native mode&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-server/reporting-services-report-server-native-mode.md) for Management Studio. You can create and run script that sets server properties programmatically. For more information, see [Script deployment and administrative tasks](../../reporting-services/tools/script-deployment-and-administrative-tasks.md) and [Report server system properties](../../reporting-services/report-server-web-service/net-framework/reporting-services-properties-report-server-system-properties.md).  
  
-   Use the web portal to grant permissions to access the report server. Permissions are conveyed through role assignments that you define for each user or group account. For more information, see [Roles and permissions &#40;Reporting Services&#41;](../../reporting-services/security/roles-and-permissions-reporting-services.md).  
  
-   Optionally, modify configuration files to change application settings. For more information about each file and guidelines for modifying them, see [Reporting Services configuration files](../../reporting-services/report-server/reporting-services-configuration-files.md).
