# Create data connection strings - Report Builder & SSRS

[!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-2016-and-later](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-2016-and-later.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto-pbirsi](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-pbirs.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto-sharepoint-2013-2016i](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-sharepoint-2013-2016.md)]

To include data in [!INCLUDE[ssRBnoversion](../../includes/ssrbnoversion.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] paginated reports, you must first create a *connection string* to your *data source*. This article explains how to create data connection strings and important information related to data source credentials. A data source includes the data source type, connection information, and the type of credentials to use. For more background, see [Intro to Report Data in SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)](report-data-ssrs.md).

## <a name="bkmk_DataConnections"></a> Built-in data extensions

Default data extensions in [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] include Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Azure SQL Database, and Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services. For a full list of data sources and versions [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] supports, see [Data Sources Supported by Reporting Services (SSRS)](../../reporting-services/report-data/data-sources-supported-by-reporting-services-ssrs.md).

## <a name="bkmk_connection_examples"></a> Common connection string examples

Connection strings are the text representation of connection properties for a data provider. The following table lists examples of connections strings for various data connection types.

> [!NOTE]
> [Connectionstrings.com](https://www.connectionstrings.com/) is another resource to get examples for connection strings.

If you fail to connect to a report server using **localhost**, check that the network protocol for TCP/IP protocol is enabled. For more information, see [Configure Client Protocols](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-client-protocols.md).

For more information about the configurations needed to connect to these data source types, see the specific data connection article under [Add Data from External Data Sources (SSRS)](../../reporting-services/report-data/add-data-from-external-data-sources-ssrs.md) or [Data Sources Supported by Reporting Services (SSRS)](../../reporting-services/report-data/data-sources-supported-by-reporting-services-ssrs.md).

## <a name="bkmk_special_password_characters"></a> Special characters in a password

If you configure your ODBC or SQL data source to prompt for a password or include the password in the connection string, when a user enters the password with special characters (like punctuation marks), some underlying data source drivers can't validate those special characters. When you process the report, the message "Not a valid password" might indicate this problem. If changing the password is impractical, you can work with your database administrator to store the appropriate credentials on the server as part of a system ODBC data source name (DSN). For more information, see [OdbcConnection.ConnectionString](/dotnet/api/system.data.odbc.odbcconnection.connectionstring) in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] documentation.

## <a name="bkmk_Expressions_in_connection_strings"></a> Expression-based connection strings

Expression-based connection strings are evaluated at run time. For example, you can specify the data source as a parameter, include the parameter reference in the connection string, and allow the user to choose a data source for the report. For example, suppose a multinational firm has data servers in several countries/regions. With an expression-based connection string, a user who is running a sales report can select a data source for a particular country/region before running the report.

The following example illustrates the use of a data source expression in a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] connection string. The example assumes you created a report parameter named `ServerName`:

```  
="Data Source=" & Parameters!ServerName.Value & "; Initial Catalog=AdventureWorks"  
```

Data source expressions are processed at run time or when a report is previewed. The expression must be written in [!INCLUDE[visual-basic](../../includes/visual-basic-md.md)]. Use the following guidelines when defining a data source expression:

- Design the report using a static connection string. A static connection string is a connection string that isn't set through an expression. For example, when you follow the steps for creating a report-specific or shared data source, you're defining a static connection string. Using a static connection string allows you to connect to the data source in Report Designer so you can get the query results you need to create the report.

- When defining the data source connection, don't use a shared data source. You can't use a data source expression in a shared data source. You must define an embedded data source for the report.

- Specify credentials separately from the connection string. You can use stored credentials, prompted credentials, or integrated security.

- Add a report parameter to specify a data source. For parameter values, you can either provide a static list of available values or define a query that retrieves a list of data sources at run time. In this case, the static list of available values should be data sources you can use with the report.

- Be sure that the list of data sources shares the same database schema. All report design begins with schema information. If there's a mismatch between the schema used to define the report and the actual schema used by the report at run time, the report might not run.

- Before publishing the report, replace the static connection string with an expression. Wait until you're finished designing the report before you replace the static connection string with an expression. Once you use an expression, you can't execute the query in Report Designer. Furthermore, the field list in the Report Data pane and the Parameters list doesn't update automatically.
