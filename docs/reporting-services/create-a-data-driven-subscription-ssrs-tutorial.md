# Create a data-driven subscription (SSRS Tutorial)

Learn about how you create a data-driven subscription by using the SQL Server Report Service (SSRS) tutorial. The tutorial walks you through a simple example that creates a data-driven subscription to generate and save filtered report output to a shared file. 

[!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] data-driven subscriptions allow you to customize and automate the distribution of a report based on dynamic subscriber data. Use [data-driven subscriptions](../reporting-services/subscriptions/data-driven-subscriptions.md) in the following scenarios:  
  
- Distribute reports to a large recipient pool whose membership might change from one distribution to the next. For example, email a monthly report to all current customers.  
- Distribute reports to a specific group of recipients based on predefined criteria. For example, send a sales performance report to all sales managers in an organization.
- Automate the generation of reports in a wide variety of formats, for example `.xlsx` and `.pdf`.  
  
## Prerequisites 
  
Report server administrators typically create and maintain data-driven subscriptions. The steps to create data-driven subscriptions require building queries, knowledge of data sources that contain subscriber data, and elevated permissions on a report server.  
  
The tutorial uses the *Sales order* report created in the tutorial [Create a basic table report &#40;SSRS tutorial&#41;](../reporting-services/create-a-basic-table-report-ssrs-tutorial.md) and data from the sample database **AdventureWorks2022**.  
  
Your computer must have the following installed to use this tutorial:  
  
- An edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that supports data-driven subscriptions. For more information, see [Editions and supported features of SQL Server 2022](../sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2022.md).
  
- Run the Report Server in native mode. The user interface described in the tutorial is based on a native mode report server. Subscriptions are supported on SharePoint mode report servers but the user interface is different than what is described in the tutorial.  
  
- SQL Server Agent service.  
  
- A [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion_md](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] role assignment that includes the **Manage all subscriptions** task on the sample report. This task defines a data-driven subscription. If you're an administrator on the computer, the default role assignment for local administrators provides the permissions necessary for creating data-driven subscriptions. For more information, see [Grant permissions on a native mode report server](../reporting-services/security/granting-permissions-on-a-native-mode-report-server.md).  
  
- Write permissions to a shared folder thatâ€™s accessible over a network connection.
  
**Estimated time to complete the tutorial:** 30 minutes. An extra 30 minutes if you need to complete the basic report tutorial.  

## Tutorial workflow

The tutorial is divided into three lessons:

| Lesson | Description |
|------|------------ |
| [Lesson 1: Create a sample subscriber database](../reporting-services/lesson-1-creating-a-sample-subscriber-database.md) | Create a table in the local SQL Server database that contains subscriber information. This information includes the order numbers to use for filtering and output file formats. |
| [Lesson 2: Configure report data source properties](../reporting-services/lesson-2-modifying-the-report-data-source-properties.md) | Configure a report data source to run a report unattended and on a schedule. Modify the report dataset to include a parameter supplied by the subscriber data. |
| [Lesson 3: Define a data-driven subscription](../reporting-services/lesson-3-defining-a-data-driven-subscription.md) | Create a data-driven subscription by using the Data-Driven Subscription Wizard. |

The following diagram illustrates the basic workflow of the process:

| Step    | Description |
| --------|------------ |
| (1)     | The subscription configuration sets the source report, schedule, and the field mapping to the subscribers Database. |
| (2)     | The **OrderInfo** table contains four order numbers to use for filtering, 1 per file. The table also contains the file formats for the generated reports. |
| (3)     | Information from the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database is filtered and returned in the report. |
| (4)     | Reports created in the file formats specified by the **OrderInfo** table. |
