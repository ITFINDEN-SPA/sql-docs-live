# Configure the unattended execution account (Report Server Configuration Manager)

  [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] provides a special account that is used for unattended report processing and for sending connection requests across the network. The account is used in the following ways:  
  
- Send connection requests over the network for reports that use database authentication, or connect to external report data sources that don't require or use authentication. For more information, see [Specify credential and connection information for report data sources](../../reporting-services/report-data/specify-credential-and-connection-information-for-report-data-sources.md).

- Retrieve external image files that are used in report. If you want to use an image file and the file can't be accessed through Anonymous access, you can configure the unattended report processing account and grant the account permission to access the file.  
  
 Unattended report processing refers to any report execution process that an event triggers (either a schedule-driven event or data refresh event) rather than a user request. The report server uses the unattended report processing account to sign in to the computer that hosts the external data source. This account is necessary because the credentials of the Report Server service account are never used to connect to other computers.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Configuring the account is optional. However, if you don't configure it, you limit your options for connecting to some data sources, and you might not be able to retrieve image files from remote computers. If you do configure the account, you must keep it up to date. Specifically, if you allow a password to expire or the account information is changed in Active Directory, you'll encounter the following error the next time a report is processed: "Logon failed (rsLogonFailed) Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password." Proper maintenance of the unattended report processing account is essential, even if you never retrieve external images or send connection requests to external computers. If you configure the account but then find that you aren't using it, you can delete it to avoid routine account maintenance tasks.  
  
## How to configure the account  

 You must use a domain user account. To serve its intended purpose, this account should be different than the one used to run the Report Server service. Be sure to use an account that has minimum permissions (read-only access with network connection permissions is sufficient) and limited access to just those computers that provide data sources and resources to the report server.  
  
 To specify the account, you can use the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Configuration tool or the **rsconfig** utility. The easiest way to configure the unattended execution account is to run the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Configuration tool and specify credentials in the Execution Account page.  
  
1. Start the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Configuration tool and connect to the report server instance you want to configure. For instructions, see [Report Server Configuration Manager &#40;Native Mode&#41;](../../reporting-services/install-windows/reporting-services-configuration-manager-native-mode.md).  
  
1. On the Execution Account page, select **Specify an execution account**.  
  
1. Enter the account and password, enter the password again, and then select **Apply**.  
  
### Use rsconfig utility  

 Another way to set the account is to use the **rsconfig** utility. To specify the account, use the **-e** argument of **rsconfig**. Specifying the **-e** argument for **rsconfig** directs the utility to write the account information to the configuration file. You don't need to specify a path to RSreportserver.config. Follow these steps to configure the account.  
  
1. Create or select a domain account that has access to computers and servers that provide data or services to a report server. You should use an account that has reduced permissions (for example, read-only permissions).  
  
1. Open a command prompt: On the **Start** menu, select **Run**, enter **cmd**, and then choose **OK**.  
  
1. Enter the following command to configure the account on a local report server instance:  
  
     **rsconfig -e -u\<domain/username> -p\<password>**  
  
 **rsconfig -e** supports other arguments. For more information about syntax and to view command examples, see [rsconfig Utility &#40;SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/tools/rsconfig-utility-ssrs.md).

### How account information is stored  

 When you set the account, the following settings are specified as encrypted values in the RSreportserver.config file on a local or remote report server instance:  
  
```  
<UnattendedExecutionAccount>  
     <UserName></UserName>  
     <Password></Password>  
     <Domain></Domain>  
</UnattendedExecutionAccount>  
```  
  
 Once you set the values, you can't decrypt them to view the values in plain text. If you mistype the values or forget the values you specified, you must use the Reporting Services Configuration tool or run **rsconfig -e** to start over.  
  
## How to use the unattended report processing account  

 To retrieve image files, the report server uses the account automatically and no specific action is required on your part. To use the account to connect to external data sources that provide data to reports, you must specify a **Credential Type** option in the data source properties page of the report data source or shared data source:  
  
- In the [!INCLUDE[ssRSWebPortal](../../includes/ssrswebportal.md)] or on a SharePoint site, select the **Credentials are not required** option.  

> [!NOTE]
> Reporting Services integration with SharePoint is no longer available after SQL Server 2016.
  
 The unattended report processing account is used primarily to connect to external servers, and not as a sign-in to database servers. If you want to use the account credentials to sign in to a database, you must specify credentials in the connection string. You can specify **Integrated Security=SSPI** if the database server supports Windows integrated security and the account used for unattended report processing has permission to read the database. Otherwise, you must enter the user name and password in the connection string, where it appears in clear text to any user who has permission to edit data source connection properties.  
  
 Although you aren't prevented from using the unattended report processing account to retrieve data after the connection is made, doing so isn't recommended. The account is supposed to be used for specific functions. If you use it to retrieve data, you undermine the purpose for which it's intended.  
  
## How to maintain the unattended report processing account  

 Once you define the account, you must ensure that the account and password are kept up to date. You can use the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Configuration tool to update the configuration settings that store information about this account.  
  
1. Start the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Configuration tool and connect to the report server instance you want to configure.  
  
1. On the Execution Account page, verify that **Specify an execution account** is selected.  
  
1. Enter the new account or password, enter the password again, and then select **Apply**.  
  
## How to delete the unattended report processing account  

 If you aren't using the account, you can delete it to avoid routine account maintenance tasks.  
  
1. Start the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Configuration tool and connect to the report server instance you want to configure.  
  
1. On the Execution Account page, clear **Specify an execution account**.  
  
1. Select **Apply**.  
  
 The account information is removed from the RSReportServer.config file.
