Learn how to find the  product key for SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) 2017 and later so you can install your server in a production environment.

To find your product key, you start by downloading and running setup for SQL Server.

1. [Download SQL Server](../../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server.md).
1. Run SQL Server setup and copy the prepopulated key:

1. [Download Reporting Services](install-reporting-services.md), run setup, and paste the key:

You should only have to do this step the first time you install Reporting Services. Servicing updates shouldn't require you to enter the key.

## Volume licensing in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center
If your volume licensing has moved to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, you can find your product key by choosing a SQL Server version and then looking under the View Downloads section:

**Billing** > **Your Products** > **Volume Licensing** > **View Downloads and Keys** > **Find SQL Server** > **View Downloads** > **View additional instructions**.
