# What is Report Server Configuration Manager (Native mode)?

[!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-2016-and-later](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-2016-and-later.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto-pbirsi](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-pbirs.md)]

Use the Report Server Configuration Manager to configure a SQL Server [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] (SSRS) Native mode installation to perform the following tasks:  
  
- **Configure the Report Server service account**: The account is configured during setup, but you can modify it by using the Report Server Configuration Manager if you update the password or want to use a different account.  
  
- **Create and configure URLs**: The report server and the [!INCLUDE[ssRSWebPortal](../../includes/ssrswebportal.md)] are [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] applications accessed through URLs. The report server URL provides access to the SOAP endpoints of the report server. The [!INCLUDE[ssRSWebPortal](../../includes/ssrswebportal.md)] URL opens the [!INCLUDE[ssRSWebPortal](../../includes/ssrswebportal.md)]. Use the Report Server Configuration Manager to configure a single URL or multiple URLs for each application.  
  
- **Create and configure the report server database**: The report server is a stateless server that requires a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database for internal storage. Use the Report Server Configuration Manager to create and configure a connection to the report server database. You can select an existing report server database that already contains the content that you want to use.  
  
- **Configure a Native mode scale-out deployment**: [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] supports a deployment topology that allows multiple report server instances to use a single, shared report server database. To deploy a report server scale-out deployment, use the Report Server Configuration Manager to connect each report server to the shared report server database.  
  
- **Backup, restore, or replace the symmetric key**: A symmetric key encrypts stored connection strings and credentials. You must have a backup of the symmetric key if you change the service account or move a report server database to another computer.  
  
- **Configure the unattended execution account**: This account enables remote connections during scheduled operations or when user credentials aren't available.  
  
- **Configure report server email**: [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] includes a report server email delivery extension that uses a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to deliver reports or report processing notifications to an electronic mailbox. Use the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager to specify which SMTP server or gateway on your network to use for email delivery.  
  
A full deployment requires that you also use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] to enable other features or modify default values. You can also use the [web portal](../../reporting-services/web-portal-ssrs-native-mode.md) to grant access to the server. For more information about the report server, see [Configure and administer a report server](../../reporting-services/report-server/configure-and-administer-a-report-server-ssrs-native-mode.md) 

> [!NOTE]
> Reporting Services integration with SharePoint is no longer available after SQL Server 2016. Starting with the [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] release, the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager isn't designed to manage SharePoint mode report servers. You manage and configure SharePoint mode by using SharePoint Central Administration and PowerShell scripts.  

##  <a name="bkmk_requirements"></a> Versions of Reporting Services

The Report Server Configuration Manager is version-specific. The Report Server Configuration Manager that installs with this version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] can't be used to configure an earlier version of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]. If you're running older and newer versions of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] side-by-side on the same computer, you must use the Report Server Configuration Manager that comes with each version to configure each instance.  

## Get started

1. Ensure that your system and permissions are set up correctly. For more information, see [Hardware and software requirements for installing SQL Server](../../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server.md).
 
1. From the Windows **Start** menu, enter **Report Server** and select **Report Server Configuration Manager** from the search results to start the Report Server Configuration Manager. Alternately, depending on your version of Microsoft Windows, you can select **Start**, go to **All Programs**, go to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrentUI](../../includes/sscurrentui-md.md)] Reporting Services, and select **Report Server Configuration Manager**.
    
   If you want to configure a report server instance from a previous version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], open the program folder for that version. For example, go to [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] instead of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrentUI](../../includes/sscurrentui-md.md)] to open the configuration tools for [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] server components and select **Report Server Configuration Manager**.

1. In **Server Name**, specify the name of the computer where the report server instance is installed. The name of the local computer appears by default. Enter the name of a remote [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance if you want to connect to a report server installed on a remote computer.

1. If you specify a remote computer, select **Find** to establish a connection.

1. In **Report Server Instance**, select the report server instance that you want to configure. Only report server instances for this version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] appear in the list. You can't configure earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)].

1. Select **Connect**.
