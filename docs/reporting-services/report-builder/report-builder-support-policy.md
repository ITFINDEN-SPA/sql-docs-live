# Microsoft Report Builder support policy

The support policy for Microsoft Report Builder is as follows.

- The SQL Server Reporting Services team adopted the [Microsoft Modern Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/modern) beginning with Microsoft Report Builder 15.0.
- Read the original [Modern Lifecycle Policy announcement](/lifecycle/announcements/modern-policy).
- For more information, see the [Modern Policy FAQ](/lifecycle/faq/modern-policy).

## Microsoft Report Builder updates

Beginning with version 15.0, all security updates, critical updates, hotfixes, and any new features are released only in the latest point version of the major version. Once a new version of Microsoft Report Builder is released for public, whether it's a point version within a major version or a major version itself, all prior versions are out of support. The [Modern Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/modern) describes this process.

For the best experience, we recommend that customers install the most recent version of [Microsoft Report Builder](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53613) from Official Microsoft Download Center.

### Full support servicing phase

When you're running the latest current branch version of Microsoft Report Builder, you receive all updates:

- Security updates
- Critical updates
- New features
