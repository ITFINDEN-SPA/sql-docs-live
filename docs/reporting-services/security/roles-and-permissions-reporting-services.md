# Roles and permissions in Reporting Services

Reporting Services provides an authentication subsystem and role-based authorization model. Authentication and authorization models vary depending on whether the report server runs in native mode or SharePoint mode. If the report server is part of a SharePoint deployment, SharePoint permissions determine who can access the report server.  
  
## Identity and access control for native mode  

Default authentication is based on Windows authentication and integrated security. You can change the authentication settings to allow the report server to respond to different authentication requests. Or, you can replace the default security features with a custom authentication extension that you provide. For more information, see [Grant permissions on a native mode report server](/sql/reporting-services/security/granting-permissions-on-a-native-mode-report-server).
  
Authorization is based on roles that you assign to a principal. Each role consists of a set of related tasks, which are in turn composed of related operations. For example, the **Content Manager** role has the **Manage reports** task. This task grants access to the following report server operations: view reports, add reports, update reports, delete reports, schedule reports, and update report properties.

### Roles and system roles

Report servers have two types of roles that you can define: 

- [**Item roles**](#item-roles)
- [**System roles**](#system-roles)

### Item roles

Item roles come with the following tasks that you can assign:

|Task                             |Description                                                                                                                      |

|Execute Report Definitions     |Start execution from report definition without publishing it to Report Server.                       |

## Identity and access control for SharePoint mode  

In SharePoint integrated mode, authentication and authorization are handled on the SharePoint site, before requests reach the report server. Depending on how you configure authentication, requests from a SharePoint site include a security token or a trusted user name. Permissions that you set for SharePoint users and groups authorize access to report server items that are placed in SharePoint libraries. For more information, see [Grant permissions on report server items on a SharePoint site](/sql/reporting-services/security/granting-permissions-on-report-server-items-on-a-sharepoint-site).
