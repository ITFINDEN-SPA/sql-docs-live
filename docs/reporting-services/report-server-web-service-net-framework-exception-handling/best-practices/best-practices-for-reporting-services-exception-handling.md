# Best practices for Reporting Services exception management
  When you develop [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] applications, there are several methodologies you can use to eliminate or reduce the occurrence of exceptions. When exceptions do occur, provide clear and concise error messages to the user, and add adequate exception handling to prevent your applications from ending unexpectedly.  
  
 An application that sends requests to the Report Server Web service should:  
  
-   Avoid causing exceptions by preventing as many invalid requests as possible.  
  
-   Catch exceptions and provide specific error-handling code whenever possible.  
  
-   Deal with error cases that don't throw exceptions.
