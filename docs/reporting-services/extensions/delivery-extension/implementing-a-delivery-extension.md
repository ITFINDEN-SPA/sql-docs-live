# Implement a delivery extension
  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] enables users to create and publish reports that, once created and published, can be delivered to various locations. In addition, [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] includes several delivery extensions and a delivery API that enable developers to create more delivery extensions to further extend the functionality of delivery in [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 For a sample implementation of a delivery extension, see [SQL Server Reporting Services Product Samples](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=177889).  
  
## In this section
