# SELECT statement limitations

An aggregate-function column can't be mixed with a non-aggregate column in a `SELECT` statement.

The select list of a `SELECT` statement that has a `GROUP BY` clause can only have expressions from the `GROUP BY` clause or set functions.

The use of an asterisk (to select all columns) in a `SELECT` statement containing a `GROUP BY` clause isn't supported. The names of the columns to be selected must be specified.

The use of a vertical bar in a `SELECT` statement isn't supported. Use a parameter in the `SELECT` statement if you need to refer to a data value that contains a vertical bar.

When using a column alias in a `SELECT` statement, the word "as" must precede the alias. For example, `SELECT col1 as a from b`. Without the `as`, the statement returns an error.

If an incorrect column name is entered into a `SELECT` statement, a SQLSTATE 07001 error, "Wrong Number of Parameters," is returned instead of a SQLSTATE S0022 error, "Column Not Found."

When the Microsoft Excel driver is used, if an empty string is inserted into a column, the empty string is converted to a `NULL`; a searched `SELECT` statement that is executed with an empty string in the `WHERE` clause doesn't succeed on that column.
