# ALTER TABLE statement limitations

When the dBASE or Paradox driver is used, once an index is created and a new record added, the structure of the table can't be changed by the `ALTER TABLE` statement unless the index is dropped and the contents of the table are deleted.

`ALTER TABLE` statements aren't supported for the Microsoft Excel or Text drivers.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you use the Paradox driver without implementing the Borland Database Engine, `ALTER TABLE` statements aren't supported; only read and append statements are allowed.
