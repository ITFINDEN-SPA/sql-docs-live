# Install SSMA for DB2 client (DB2ToSQL)

The SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) client consists of the program files that perform the following tasks:

- Connect to a DB2 database.
- Connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
- Convert DB2 database objects to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] syntax.
- Load the objects into [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
- Migrate data to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

This article provides the installation prerequisites and instructions for installing SSMA.

## Prerequisites

SSMA is designed to work with DB2 on z/OS version 9.0, 10.0, and later versions, DB2 on LUW version 9.8, 10.1, and later versions, DB2 for i version 7.1 and later versions, and [!INCLUDE [sssql11-md](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later versions.

Before you install SSMA, make sure that the computer meets the following requirements:

- Windows 7 or later versions, or Windows Server 2008 or later versions.
- [!INCLUDE [msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows Installer 3.1 or later versions.
- The [!INCLUDE [msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] version 4.7.2 or a later version. You can obtain it from the [.NET Framework Developer Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=48882).
- Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2 version 5 or a later version, and connectivity to the DB2 databases that you want to migrate.
- Access to and sufficient permissions on the computer that hosts the target instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL Database where you are migrating database objects and data. For more information, see [Connecting to SQL Server (DB2ToSQL)](connecting-to-sql-server-db2tosql.md).
- 4 GB RAM recommended.
