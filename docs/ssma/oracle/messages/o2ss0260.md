# O2SS0260: Wrapped package cannot be converted (Error)

This article covers the reason why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle doesn't convert the wrapped code.

## Background

Wrapping (encrypting) is a process of hiding the source code. Wrapping helps to protect the source code from the competitors and others who might misuse it. In Oracle, one can wrap the source code using `DBMS_DDL` subprograms.

Whenever you try to convert the wrapped (encrypted) PL/SQL code, SSMA gives a warning message saying that the `Required code is wrapped`. When you skip this warning by selecting the **Continue** button, SSMA generates an error message. Also, you're able to view only the *Conversion statistics* and not the code in the **Assessment Report** window, as the code is wrapped.

## Example

In the following example, you declare two variables, one to store the package specification and another to store package body as strings. These variables are then passed to a predefined stored procedure `DBMS_DDL.CREATE_WRAPPED`, which creates a wrapped package.

```sql
DECLARE
    src_pkg_header VARCHAR2(32767);
    src_pkg_body VARCHAR2(32767);
BEGIN
    src_pkg_header :=
        'CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE Wrapped_PKG IS ' ||
            'x pls_integer; ' ||
        'END Wrapped_PKG; ';

    src_pkg_body :=
        'CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY Wrapped_PKG IS ' ||
        'BEGIN ' ||
            'x := 10; ' ||
        'END Wrapped_PKG;';

    SYS.DBMS_DDL.CREATE_WRAPPED(ddl => src_pkg_header);
    SYS.DBMS_DDL.CREATE_WRAPPED(ddl => src_pkg_body);
END;
```

When you execute the previous code in Oracle, a package with name `Wrapped_PKG` is created. This package is created in encrypted format, so you can't view the text/code inside this package.

When you try to convert the package `Wrapped_PKG` code using SSMA, you get the following error:

> O2SS0260: Wrapped package cannot be converted

## Possible remedies

The solution to the previous error can be divided into the following steps:

**Step 1:** Create and execute only the package code in Oracle. Then convert this code into corresponding [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] code using SSMA.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE Wrapped_PKG IS
    x pls_integer;
END Wrapped_PKG;

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY Wrapped_PKG IS
BEGIN
    x := 10;
END Wrapped_PKG;
```

The following example is the corresponding [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] code for the previous package:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.WRAPPED_PKG$SSMA_Initialize_Package
AS
BEGIN
    EXECUTE ssma_oracle.db_clean_storage

    EXECUTE ssma_oracle.set_pv_int
        DB_NAME(),
        'DBO',
        'WRAPPED_PKG',
        'X',
        10
END
```

**Step 2:** Add `WITH ENCRYPTION` keyword to the converted Transact-SQL code as shown in the following example. This encrypts your code in [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.WRAPPED_PKG$SSMA_Initialize_Package
WITH ENCRYPTION
AS
BEGIN
    EXECUTE ssma_oracle.db_clean_storage

    EXECUTE ssma_oracle.set_pv_int
        DB_NAME(),
        'DBO',
        'WRAPPED_PKG',
        'X',
        10
END
```
