# O2SS0418: Failed to parse statement batch with package definition (Error)

This article describes why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle doesn't convert the PL/SQL block when using invalid syntax while creating a package in Oracle code.

## Background

Whenever there's an invalid syntax while creating a package in Oracle code, SSMA generates an error message.

## Example

In the following example, you create a package `Empty_Pkg4` with invalid syntax:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE Empty_Pkg4
IS
BEGIN -- error!
    PVT INT := 10;
END;
```

When you try to convert the previous code in SSMA, it generates the following error message:

> O2SS0418: Failed to parse statement batch with package definition

## Possible remedies

To resolve this error, you can correct the source code and delete the invalid syntax in Oracle. In our example we have to delete the `BEGIN` statement from the Oracle source code, as shown in the following code:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE Empty_Pkg4
IS
    PVT INT := 10;
END;
```

Another remedy is to verify if any application code calls the package containing the invalid syntax. If not, remove the package from your migration project.
