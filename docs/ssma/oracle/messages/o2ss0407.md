# O2SS0407: Unsupported collection key type (Error)

This article covers some of the reasons why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle can't convert some of the statements that have the collection or records data type.

## Background

A collection is an ordered group of elements, all of the same type. It's a general concept that encompasses lists, arrays, and other familiar data types. Each element has a unique subscript that determines its position in the collection. When using a nested type collection, the key can either be an integer (default) or string type.

SSMA provides a migration path for Oracle collections. However, SSMA doesn't support the collection key besides integer and string. So when SSMA encounters any collection variable with index key other than integer and string, it generates the error message.

## Example

In the following example, you have `number_colln_dec_index`, which is a user defined type indexed by `DECIMAL`. With this collection type, you create a `money_index` object.

```sql
DECLARE
    TYPE number_colln_dec_index IS TABLE OF NUMBER INDEX BY DECIMAL;
    money_index number_colln_dec_index;
BEGIN
    NULL;
END;
```

When you try to convert the previous code in SSMA, it generates the following error message:

> O2SS0407: Unsupported collection key type

## Possible remedies

The general solution for this kind of problem is to replace the index key with either integer or any supported string type, like `VARCHAR2`. For our example, since the table is of type `NUMBER`, replacing the index key `DECIMAL` with `INTEGER` would allow SSMA to convert the schema successfully.

```sql
DECLARE
    TYPE number_colln_dec_index IS TABLE OF NUMBER INDEX BY INTEGER;
    money_index number_colln_dec_index;
BEGIN
    NULL;
END;
```
