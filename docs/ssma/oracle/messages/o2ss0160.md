# O2SS0160: SELECT statement not converted (Error)

This article describes why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle doesn't convert the `SELECT` statement in two scenarios that have malformed `ORDER BY` clauses.

## Background

There are cases when SSMA can't convert complex `SELECT` statements.

## Possible remedies

There are two scenarios, in which SSMA doesn't convert the select statement and generate an error message.

### Scenario 1: `SELECT DISTINCT` statement is used with `CONNECT BY PRIOR` statement in the hierarchical query

Consider the following example:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    empno,
    MGR,
    ename
FROM
    emp
START WITH MGR = 7902
CONNECT BY PRIOR MGR = empno;
```

When you try to convert the previous code in SSMA, it generates the following error message:

> O2SS0160: SELECT statement not converted

To resolve this issue, use the `ORDER BY` clause in the source code of Oracle, as shown in the following example:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    empno,
    MGR,
    ename
FROM
    emp
START WITH MGR = 7902
CONNECT BY PRIOR MGR = empno
ORDER BY empno;
```

SSMA now successfully converts the query.

### Scenario 2: `ORDER BY` clause sorts result set based on two columns, but only one column is specified in `SELECT` clause

Consider the following example:

```sql
SELECT Empno
FROM emp
ORDER BY 1, 2;
```

When you try to convert the previous code in SSMA, it generates the following error message:

> O2SS0160: SELECT statement not converted

To resolve this error, either reduce the number of columns in the `ORDER BY` clause, or add more columns in the `SELECT` clause.

Here's an updated query with the second column removed from the `ORDER BY`:

```sql
SELECT Deptno
FROM emp
ORDER BY 1;
```

SSMA now successfully converts the query.
