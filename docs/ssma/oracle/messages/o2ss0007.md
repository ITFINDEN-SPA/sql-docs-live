# O2SS0007: Check constraint condition not parsed (Error)

This article covers the reason why SSMA for Oracle isn't able to convert a `BINARY_FLOAT` column with a constraint for checking a `NAN` (Not a Number) condition.

## Background

In Oracle, the `BINARY_FLOAT` data type allows an application to store number underflow or overflow values. [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] generates an error as soon as a number overflow or underflow is computed and thus can't store the value in a `FLOAT` data type. When you try to convert the schema of a table having a constraint condition, which is checking for `NAN` values, SSMA generates an error because [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] doesn't support floating point conditions like `NAN`.

## Example

In the following example, you create a table, and alter it by adding a constraint of `NAN` type:

```sql
CREATE TABLE NANTEST
(
    COL1 BINARY_FLOAT
);
/

ALTER TABLE NANTEST ADD CONSTRAINT NANCHECK1 CHECK (COL1 IS NOT NAN);
```

When you try to convert the schema of the previous table in SSMA, it generates the following error message:

> O2SS0007: Check constraint condition not parsed

## Possible remedies

The solution to the previous example can be divided into two steps:

**Step 1:** Create a new table in [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] without the check constraint:

```sql
CREATE TABLE NANTEST
(
    COL1 FLOAT(53)
);
```

In [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], the equivalent of `BINARY_FLOAT` is `FLOAT(53)`.

**Step 2:** Modify the application code for inserting the values in this table. Create a `TRY ... CATCH` block, which prevents users from inserting an unsupported value and generate an error message similar to an error generated from a check constraint:

```sql
DECLARE
    @VAL FLOAT(53)

BEGIN TRY
    SET @VAL = 1 / 0

    INSERT INTO NANTEST VALUES (@VAL)
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT(
        'SQL error is ' + CONVERT(varchar(20), ERROR_NUMBER())
            + ' : ' + CONVERT(varchar(100), ERROR_MESSAGE()))
END CATCH;
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Trying to use `ISNUMERIC()` function in a check constraint for this scenario isn't a viable solution, because `ISNUMERIC()` is designed to check for strings that might represent numeric values and not numeric underflow and overflow conditions.
