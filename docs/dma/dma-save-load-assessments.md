# Save and load assessments with Data Migration Assistant

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-notice](includes/deprecation-notice.md)]

The following step-by-step instructions help you use the Data Migration Assistant v5.0 or later to save a database assessment to a file, and then to load an assessment from a file.

In addition to loading assessments saved using the latest version of DMA, users can also use this feature to load assessments exported as .json files from previous versions of Data Migration Assistant to view the results in v5.0 and later.

## Save an assessment to a file

1. After running an assessment using Data Migration Assistant, select **Save Assessment**.

   The standard **Save...** dialog box appears.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > For more information about how to run an assessment in Data Migration Assistant, see the article [Perform a SQL Server migration assessment with Data Migration Assistant](dma-assesssqlonprem.md).

1. Specify a name for the file, and then select **Save**.

## Load an assessment saved to a file

1. To load an assessment you've previously saved to a file, start Data Migration Assistant, and then on the **All Assessments** tab, select **Load Assessment**.
