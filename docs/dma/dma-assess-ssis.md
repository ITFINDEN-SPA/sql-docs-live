# Perform a SQL Server Integration Service migration assessment with Data Migration Assistant

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-notice](includes/deprecation-notice.md)]

## Prerequisites

To assess SQL Server Integration Service(SSIS) packages, below components need to be installed with Data Migration Assistant:

- SQL Server Integration Service with the same version as the SSIS packages to assess.
- Azure Feature Pack or other third party components if SSIS packages to assess have these components.

DMA needs to run with **administrator** access to assess SSIS packages in Package Store.

> [!NOTE]  
> Source to SQL Server version 2019 and above aren't supported.
