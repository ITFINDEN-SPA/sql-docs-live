# SQL Server Services

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Windows Only](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only.md)]

This section contains F1 Help topics for the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Services dialog boxes in [!INCLUDE [msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager.

If you open **SQL Server Configuration Manager** on a node of a cluster that doesn't host the resources, the services show as stopped.

If the nodes of the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Services don't populate with the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] services available on the computer, you might not have sufficient permissions to access Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). To configure permissions on WMI, search Books Online for the topic, "How to: Configure WMI to Show Server Status in SQL Server Tools."
