# Configure the cost threshold for parallelism (server configuration option)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

This article describes how to configure the **cost threshold for parallelism** server configuration option in [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)]. The **cost threshold for parallelism** option specifies the threshold at which [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] creates and runs parallel plans for queries. [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] creates and runs a parallel plan for a query only when the estimated cost to run a serial plan for the same query is higher than the value set in **cost threshold for parallelism**. The cost refers to an estimated cost required to run the serial plan on a specific hardware configuration, and isn't a unit of time. The **cost threshold for parallelism** option can be set to any value from 0 through 32767.

## Limitations

The cost refers to an abstracted unit of cost and not a unit of estimated time. Only set **cost threshold for parallelism** on symmetric multiprocessors.

[!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ignores the **cost threshold for parallelism** value under the following conditions:

- Your computer has only one logical processor.

- Only a single logical processor is available to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] because of the **affinity mask** configuration option.

- The **max degree of parallelism** option is set to 1.

A logical processor is the basic unit of processor hardware that allows the operating system to dispatch a task or execute a thread context. Each logical processor can execute only one thread context at a time. The processor core is the circuitry that provides ability to decode and execute instructions. A processor core may contain one or more logical processors. The following [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] query can be used for obtaining CPU information for the system.

```sql
SELECT (cpu_count / hyperthread_ratio) AS PhysicalCPUs,
    cpu_count AS logicalCPUs
FROM sys.dm_os_sys_info;
```

## Recommendations

- This option is an advanced option and should be changed only by an experienced database administrator or certified [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] professional.

- In certain cases, a parallel plan may be chosen even though the query's cost plan is less than the current **cost threshold for parallelism** value. This can happen because the decision to use a parallel or serial plan is based on a cost estimate provided earlier in the optimization process. For more information, see the [Query Processing Architecture Guide](../../relational-databases/query-processing-architecture-guide.md#parallel-query-processing).

- While the default value of `5` is adequate for most systems, a different value may be appropriate. Perform application testing with higher and lower values if needed to optimize application performance.

## Permissions

Execute permissions on `sp_configure` with no parameters or with only the first parameter are granted to all users by default. To execute `sp_configure` with both parameters to change a configuration option or to run the RECONFIGURE statement, a user must be granted the ALTER SETTINGS server-level permission. The ALTER SETTINGS permission is implicitly held by the **sysadmin** and **serveradmin** fixed server roles.

## <a id="SSMSProcedure"></a> Use SQL Server Management Studio

1. In Object Explorer, right-click a server and select **Properties**.

1. Select the **Advanced** node.

1. Under **Parallelism**, change the **Cost Threshold for Parallelism** option to the value you want. Type or select a value from 0 to 32767.

## <a id="TsqlProcedure"></a> Use Transact-SQL

This example shows how to use [sp_configure](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-configure-transact-sql.md) to set the value of the `cost threshold for parallelism` option to `10`.

```sql
USE master;
GO
EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
GO
RECONFIGURE
GO
EXEC sp_configure 'cost threshold for parallelism', 10;
GO
RECONFIGURE
GO
```

For more information, see [Server Configuration Options (SQL Server)](server-configuration-options-sql-server.md).

## <a id="FollowUp"></a> Follow Up: After you configure the cost threshold for parallelism option

The setting takes effect immediately without restarting the server.
