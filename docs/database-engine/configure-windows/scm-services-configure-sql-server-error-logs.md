# SQL Server Configuration Manager: Configure SQL Server error logs

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

This article describes how to view or modify the way [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error logs are recycled.

## Open the Configure SQL Server Error Logs dialog box

1. In Object Explorer, expand the instance of SQL Server, expand **Management**, right-click **SQL Server Logs**, and then select **Configure**.

1. In the **Configure SQL Server Error Logs** dialog box, choose from the following options.

   - Log files count

      **Limit the number of the error log files before they are recycled**

      Check to limit the number of error logs created before they're recycled. A new error log is created each time an instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is started. [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] retains backups of the previous six logs, unless you check this option, and specify a different maximum number of error log files.

      **Maximum number of error log files**

      Specify the maximum number of archived error log files created before they're recycled. The default is 6, not including the current one. This value determines the number of previous backup logs that [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] retains before recycling them.

   - Log file size

      **Maximum size for error log file in KB**

      You can set the size amount of each file in KB. If you leave it at `0`, the log size is unlimited.
