# Change server authentication mode

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

This article describes how to change the server authentication mode in [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)]. During installation, [!INCLUDE [ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] is set to either **Windows Authentication mode** or **SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode**. After installation, you can change the authentication mode at any time.

If **Windows Authentication mode** is selected during installation, the `sa` login is disabled and a password is assigned by setup. If you later change authentication mode to **SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode**, the `sa` login remains disabled. To use the `sa` login, use the `ALTER LOGIN` statement to enable the `sa` login and assign a new password. The `sa` login can only connect to the server by using [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication.

## Remarks

The `sa` account is a well known [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] account, and is often targeted by malicious users. Don't enable the `sa` account unless your application requires it. It's important that you use a strong password for the `sa` login.

You can enable the `sa` login with SSMS or Transact-SQL.

### [SQL Server Management Studio](#tab/ssms)

1. In Object Explorer, expand **Security**, expand Logins, right-click **sa**, and then select **Properties**.

1. On the **General** page, you might have to create and confirm a password for the `sa` login.

1. On the **Status** page, in the **Login** section, select **Enabled**, and then select **OK**.

### [Transact-SQL](#tab/t-sql)

The following example enables the `sa` login and sets a new password. Replace `<enterStrongPasswordHere>` with a strong password before you run it.

```sql
ALTER LOGIN sa ENABLE;
GO
ALTER LOGIN sa WITH PASSWORD = '<enterStrongPasswordHere>';
GO
```

## <a id="use-ssms"></a> Change authentication mode with SQL Server Management Studio

1. In [!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] (SSMS) Object Explorer, right-click the server, and then select **Properties**.

1. On the **Security** page, under **Server authentication**, select the new server authentication mode, and then select **OK**.

1. In the [!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] dialog box, select **OK** to acknowledge the requirement to restart [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

1. In Object Explorer, right-click your server, and then select **Restart**. If [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent is running, it must also be restarted.

## Examples

> [!CAUTION]  
> The following examples use an extended stored procedure to modify the server registry. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. These problems might require you to reinstall the operating system. Microsoft can't guarantee that these problems can be resolved. Modify the registry at your own risk.

The permissions required to change the authentication mode are [sysadmin](../../relational-databases/security/authentication-access/server-level-roles.md#fixed-server-level-roles) or [CONTROL SERVER](../../relational-databases/security/permissions-database-engine.md).

### A. Change authentication to Windows only

1. Change server authentication to Windows only:

   ```sql
   USE [master]
   GO
   EXEC xp_instance_regwrite N'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE',
        N'Software\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\MSSQLServer',
        N'LoginMode', REG_DWORD, 1;
   GO
   ```

1. Disable the `sa` account:

   ```sql
   USE [master]
   GO

   ALTER LOGIN sa DISABLE;
   GO
   ```

### B. Change authentication to mixed mode (Windows and SQL)

1. Enable the `sa` account and set a strong password:

   ```sql
   USE [master]
   GO

   ALTER LOGIN sa ENABLE;
   GO

   ALTER LOGIN sa WITH PASSWORD = '<enterStrongPasswordHere>';
   GO
   ```

1. Change server authentication to mixed mode:

   ```sql
   EXEC xp_instance_regwrite N'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE',
       N'Software\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\MSSQLServer',
       N'LoginMode', REG_DWORD, 2;
   GO
   ```
