[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

Returns a miscellaneous set of useful information about the computer, and about the resources available to and consumed by [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

> [!NOTE]  
> To call this from [!INCLUDE [ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE [ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)], use the name `sys.dm_pdw_nodes_os_sys_info`. [!INCLUDE [synapse-analytics-od-unsupported-syntax](../../includes/synapse-analytics-od-unsupported-syntax.md)]

| Column name | Data type | Description and version-specific notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cpu_ticks` | **bigint** | Specifies the current CPU check count. CPU ticks are obtained from the processor's RDTSC counter. It's a monotonically increasing number. Not nullable. |
| `ms_ticks` | **bigint** | Specifies the number of milliseconds since the computer started. Not nullable. |
| `cpu_count` | **int** | Specifies the number of logical CPUs on the system. Not nullable.<br /><br />In Azure SQL Database, this column might return the number of logical CPUs on the machine hosting the database or elastic pool. To determine the number of logical CPUs available to the database or elastic pool, use the `cpu_limit` column in [sys.dm_user_db_resource_governance](sys-dm-user-db-resource-governor-azure-sql-database.md). |
| `hyperthread_ratio` | **int** | Specifies the ratio of the number of logical or physical cores that are exposed by one physical processor package. Not nullable. |
| `physical_memory_in_bytes` | **bigint** | **Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [sql2008r2](../../includes/sql2008r2-md.md)].<br /><br />Specifies the total amount of physical memory on the machine. Not nullable. |
| `physical_memory_kb` | **bigint** | **Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later versions.<br /><br />Specifies the total amount of physical memory on the machine. Not nullable.<br /><br />In Azure SQL Database, this column returns the total amount of physical memory on the machine hosting the database or elastic pool. To determine the amount of physical memory available to the database or elastic pool, use the `process_memory_limit_mb` column in [sys.dm_os_job_object](sys-dm-os-job-object-transact-sql.md). |
| `virtual_memory_in_bytes` | **bigint** | **Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [sql2008r2](../../includes/sql2008r2-md.md)].<br /><br />Amount of virtual memory available to the process in user mode. This value can be used to determine whether [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] was started by using a 3-GB switch. |
| `virtual_memory_kb` | **bigint** | **Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later versions.<br /><br />Specifies the total amount of virtual address space available to the process in user mode. Not nullable. |
| `bpool_committed` | **int** | **Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [sql2008r2](../../includes/sql2008r2-md.md)].<br /><br />Represents the committed memory in kilobytes (KB) in the memory manager. Doesn't include reserved memory in the memory manager. Not nullable. |
| `committed_kb` | **bigint** | **Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later versions.<br /><br />Represents the committed memory in kilobytes (KB) in the memory manager. Doesn't include reserved memory in the memory manager. Not nullable. |
| `bpool_commit_target` | **int** | **Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [sql2008r2](../../includes/sql2008r2-md.md)].<br /><br />Represents the amount of memory, in kilobytes (KB), that can be consumed by [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] memory manager. |
| `committed_target_kb` | **bigint** | **Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later versions.<br /><br />Represents the amount of memory, in kilobytes (KB), that can be consumed by [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] memory manager. The target amount is calculated using several inputs like:<br /><br />- the current state of the system including its load<br />- the memory requested by current processes<br />- the amount of memory installed on the computer<br />- configuration parameters<br /><br />If `committed_target_kb` is larger than `committed_kb`, the memory manager tries to obtain more memory. If `committed_target_kb` is smaller than `committed_kb`, the memory manager tries to shrink the amount of memory committed. The `committed_target_kb` always includes stolen and reserved memory. Not nullable. |
| `bpool_visible` | **int** | **Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [sql2008r2](../../includes/sql2008r2-md.md)].<br /><br />Number of 8-KB buffers in the buffer pool that are directly accessible in the process virtual address space. When not using the Address Windowing Extensions (AWE), when the buffer pool obtains its memory target (`bpool_committed = bpool_commit_target`), the value of `bpool_visible` equals the value of `bpool_committed`. When using AWE on a 32-bit version of [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], `bpool_visible` represents the size of the AWE mapping window used to access physical memory allocated by the buffer pool. The size of this mapping window is bound by the process address space, and so the visible amount is smaller than the committed amount. This value can be further reduced by internal components consuming memory, for purposes other than database pages. If the value of `bpool_visible` is too low, you might receive out of memory errors. |
| `visible_target_kb` | **bigint** | **Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later versions.<br /><br />Is the same as `committed_target_kb`. Not nullable. |

| `os_quantum` | **bigint** | Represents the Quantum for a non-preemptive task, measured in milliseconds. Quantum (in seconds) = `os_quantum` / CPU clock speed. Not nullable. |
| `os_error_mode` | **int** | Specifies the error mode for the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] process. Not nullable. |
| `os_priority_class` | **int** | Specifies the priority class for the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] process. Nullable.<br /><br />`32` = Normal. Error log says [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is starting at normal priority base (`7`).<br />`128` = High. Error log says [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is running at high priority base (`13`).<br /><br />For more information, see [Configure the priority boost (server configuration option)](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-the-priority-boost-server-configuration-option.md). |
| `max_workers_count` | **int** | Represents the maximum number of workers that can be created. Not nullable. |
| `scheduler_count` | **int** | Represents the number of user schedulers configured in the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] process. Not nullable. |
| `scheduler_total_count` | **int** | Represents the total number of schedulers in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Not nullable. |
| `deadlock_monitor_serial_number` | **int** | Specifies the ID of the current deadlock monitor sequence. Not nullable. |
| `sqlserver_start_time_ms_ticks` | **bigint** | Represents the `ms_tick` number when [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] last started. Compare to the current `ms_ticks` column. Not nullable. |
| `sqlserver_start_time` | **datetime** | Specifies the local system date and time [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] last started. Not nullable.<br /><br />Information in many other [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] DMVs only includes activity since the last database engine startup. Use this column to find the last [!INCLUDE [ssdenoversion-md](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] startup time. |
