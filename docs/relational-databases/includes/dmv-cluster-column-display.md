In a Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC), the cluster columns display the Windows cluster details. In cases where there's no Windows cluster, such as [read-scale availability groups](../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/read-scale-availability-groups.md), or [availability groups on Linux](../../linux/sql-server-linux-availability-group-overview.md), columns related to the cluster might display data about an internal default cluster. These columns are for internal use only and can be disregarded.
