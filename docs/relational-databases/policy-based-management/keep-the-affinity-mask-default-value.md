# Keep the affinity mask default value

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

This rule checks whether the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] setting for the affinity mask is set to 0, which is the default value. The affinity mask option dynamically controls CPU affinity.
