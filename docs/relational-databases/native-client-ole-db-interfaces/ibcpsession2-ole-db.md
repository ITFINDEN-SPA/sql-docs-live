The IBCPSession2 interface is an extension to IBCPSession that provides a member function that is an alternative to calling IBCPSession::BCPColFmt for each column.  IBCPSession2 inherits from IBCPSession and adds one new method: [IBCPSession2::BCPSetBulkMode](../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-interfaces/ibcpsession2-bcpsetbulkmode.md).
