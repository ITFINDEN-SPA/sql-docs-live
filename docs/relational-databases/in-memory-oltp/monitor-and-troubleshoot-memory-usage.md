# Monitor and troubleshoot memory usage with in-memory OLTP
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

[!INCLUDE [inmemory-md](../../includes/inmemory-md.md)] consumes memory in different patterns than disk-based tables. You can monitor the amount of memory allocated and used by memory-optimized tables and indexes in your database using the DMVs or performance counters provided for memory and the garbage collection subsystem. This gives you visibility at both the system and database level and lets you prevent problems due to memory exhaustion.  
  
This article covers monitoring your [!INCLUDE [inmemory](../../includes/inmemory-md.md)] memory usage for SQL Server.

## <a id="bkmk_CreateDB"></a> 1. Create a sample database with memory-optimized tables

 The following steps create a database to use for our exercise.

1. Launch [!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
1. Select **New Query**.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can skip this next step if you already have a database with memory-optimized tables.
  
1. Paste this code into the new query window and execute each section to create the test database for this exercise, `IMOLTP_DB`.

    ```sql
    -- create a database to be used  
    CREATE DATABASE IMOLTP_DB  
    GO
    ```

1. The sample script below uses `C:\Data`, but your instance likely uses different folder locations for database data files. Update the following script to use a proper location for the in-memory file location, and execute.

    ```sql
    ALTER DATABASE IMOLTP_DB ADD FILEGROUP IMOLTP_DB_xtp_fg CONTAINS MEMORY_OPTIMIZED_DATA  
    ALTER DATABASE IMOLTP_DB ADD FILE( NAME = 'IMOLTP_DB_xtp' , FILENAME = 'C:\Data\IMOLTP_DB_xtp') TO FILEGROUP IMOLTP_DB_xtp_fg;  
    GO
    ```

1. The following script will create three memory-optimized tables that you can use in the remainder of this topic. In the example, we mapped the database to a resource pool so that we can control how much memory can be taken by memory-optimized tables. Execute the following script in the `IMOLTP_DB` database.

    ```sql
    -- create some tables  
    USE IMOLTP_DB  
    GO  

    -- create the resoure pool  
    CREATE RESOURCE POOL PoolIMOLTP WITH (MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT = 60);  
    ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE;  
    GO  
  
    -- bind the database to a resource pool  
    EXEC sp_xtp_bind_db_resource_pool 'IMOLTP_DB', 'PoolIMOLTP'  
  
    -- you can query the binding using the catalog view as described here  
    SELECT d.database_id  
         , d.name  
         , d.resource_pool_id  
    FROM sys.databases d  
    GO  
  
    -- take database offline/online to finalize the binding to the resource pool  
    USE master  
    GO  
  
    ALTER DATABASE IMOLTP_DB SET OFFLINE  
    GO  
    ALTER DATABASE IMOLTP_DB SET ONLINE  
    GO  
  
    -- create some tables  
    USE IMOLTP_DB  
    GO  
  
    -- create table t1  
    CREATE TABLE dbo.t1 (  
           c1 int NOT NULL CONSTRAINT [pk_t1_c1] PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED  
         , c2 char(40) NOT NULL  
         , c3 char(8000) NOT NULL  
         ) WITH (MEMORY_OPTIMIZED = ON, DURABILITY = SCHEMA_AND_DATA)  
    GO  
  
    -- load t1 150K rows  
    DECLARE @i int = 0  
    BEGIN TRAN  
    WHILE (@i <= 150000)  
       BEGIN  
          INSERT t1 VALUES (@i, 'a', replicate ('b', 8000))  
          SET @i += 1;  
       END  
    Commit  
    GO  
  
    -- Create another table, t2  
    CREATE TABLE dbo.t2 (  
           c1 int NOT NULL CONSTRAINT [pk_t2_c1] PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED  
         , c2 char(40) NOT NULL  
         , c3 char(8000) NOT NULL  
         ) WITH (MEMORY_OPTIMIZED = ON, DURABILITY = SCHEMA_AND_DATA)  
    GO  
  
    -- Create another table, t3   
    CREATE TABLE dbo.t3 (  
           c1 int NOT NULL CONSTRAINT [pk_t3_c1] PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED HASH (c1) WITH (BUCKET_COUNT = 1000000)  
         , c2 char(40) NOT NULL  
         , c3 char(8000) NOT NULL  
         ) WITH (MEMORY_OPTIMIZED = ON, DURABILITY = SCHEMA_AND_DATA)  
    GO  
    ```  
  
## <a id="bkmk_Monitoring"></a> 2. Monitor memory usage
  
### <a id="bkmk_UsingSSMS"></a> Monitor memory usage with [!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]
 Since [!INCLUDE [ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)], [!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] has built-in standard reports to monitor the memory consumed by in-memory tables. You can access these reports using **Object Explorer**. You can also use the object explorer to monitor memory consumed by individual memory-optimized tables.  
  
#### Consumption at the database level

 You can monitor memory use at the database level as follows.  
  
1. Launch [!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] and connect to your SQL Server or SQL managed instance.
  
1. In **Object Explorer**, right-click the database you want reports on.  
  
1. In the context menu select, **Reports** -> **Standard Reports** -> **Memory Usage By Memory Optimized Objects**  
  
 :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-and-troubleshoot-memory-usage/memory-usage-by-memory-optimized-objects-report.gif" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Object Explorer with Reports > Standard Reports > Memory Usage By Memory Optimized Objects selected.":::
  
 This report shows memory consumption by the database we created above.  
  
 :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-and-troubleshoot-memory-usage/total-memory-usage-by-memory-optimized-objects-report-graph.gif" alt-text="Screenshot of the Total Memory Usage By Memory Optimized Objects report.":::
  
### <a id="bkmk_UsingDMVs"></a> Monitor memory usage with DMVs

 There are many DMVs available to monitor memory consumed by memory-optimized tables, indexes, system objects, and by run-time structures.  
  
#### Memory consumption by memory-optimized tables and indexes
 You can find memory consumption for all user tables, indexes, and system objects by querying `sys.dm_db_xtp_table_memory_stats` as shown here.  
  
```sql  
SELECT object_name(object_id) AS [Name]
     , *  
   FROM sys.dm_db_xtp_table_memory_stats;
```  
  
 **Sample Output**  
  
```output
Name       object_id   memory_allocated_for_table_kb memory_used_by_table_kb memory_allocated_for_indexes_kb memory_used_by_indexes_kb

```  
  
 For more information, see [sys.dm_db_xtp_table_memory_stats](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-xtp-table-memory-stats-transact-sql.md).  
  
#### Memory consumption by internal system structures

 Memory is also consumed by system objects, such as transactional structures, buffers for data and delta files, garbage collection structures, and more. You can find the memory used for these system objects by querying `sys.dm_xtp_system_memory_consumers` as shown here.  
  
```sql  
SELECT memory_consumer_desc  
     , allocated_bytes/1024 AS allocated_bytes_kb  
     , used_bytes/1024 AS used_bytes_kb  
     , allocation_count  
   FROM sys.dm_xtp_system_memory_consumers  
```  
  
 **Sample Output**  
  
```output
memory_consumer_ desc allocated_bytes_kb   used_bytes_kb        allocation_count

#### Memory consumption at run-time when accessing memory-optimized tables

 You can determine the memory consumed by run time structures, such as the procedure cache with the following query: run this query to get the memory used by run-time structures such as for the procedure cache. All run-time structures are tagged with XTP.  
  
```sql  
SELECT memory_object_address  
     , pages_in_bytes  
     , bytes_used  
     , type  
   FROM sys.dm_os_memory_objects WHERE type LIKE '%xtp%'  
```  
  
 **Sample Output**  
  
```output
memory_object_address pages_ in_bytes bytes_used type

#### Memory consumed by [!INCLUDE [inmemory](../../includes/inmemory-md.md)] engine across the instance

 Memory allocated to the [!INCLUDE [inmemory](../../includes/inmemory-md.md)] engine and the memory-optimized objects is managed the same way as any other memory consumer within a [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance. The clerks of type MEMORYCLERK_XTP accounts for all the memory allocated to [!INCLUDE [inmemory](../../includes/inmemory-md.md)] engine. Use the following query to find all the memory used by the [!INCLUDE [inmemory](../../includes/inmemory-md.md)] engine.  
  
   ```sql  
   -- This DMV accounts for all memory used by the in-memory engine  
   SELECT type  
      , name  
      , memory_node_id  
      , pages_kb/1024 AS pages_MB   
      FROM sys.dm_os_memory_clerks WHERE type LIKE '%xtp%'  
   ```  
  
The following sample output shows that the memory allocated is 18 MB system-level memory and 1358 MB allocated to `database_id` = 5. Since this database is mapped to a dedicated resource pool, this memory is accounted for in that resource pool.  
  
   ```output
   type                 name       memory_node_id pages_MB  
   -------------------- ---------- -------------- --------------------  
   MEMORYCLERK_XTP      Default    0              18  
   MEMORYCLERK_XTP      DB_ID_5    0              1358  
   MEMORYCLERK_XTP      Default    64             0  
   ```

## <a id="bkmk_MemOptObjects"></a> 3. Manage memory consumed by memory-optimized objects
 
 You can control the total memory consumed by memory-optimized tables by binding it to a named resource pool. For more information, see [Bind a database with memory-optimized tables to a resource pool](bind-a-database-with-memory-optimized-tables-to-a-resource-pool.md).
  
## <a id="bkmk_Troubleshooting"></a> Troubleshoot memory issues

Troubleshooting memory issues is a three-step process:  
  
1. Identify how much memory is being consumed by the objects in your database or instance. You can use a rich set of monitoring tools available for memory-optimized tables as described earlier. For example, see the sample queries on the DMVs `sys.dm_db_xtp_table_memory_stats` or `sys.dm_os_memory_clerks`.  
  
1. Determine how memory consumption is growing and how much head room you have left. By monitoring the memory consumption periodically, you can know how the memory use is growing. For example, if you have mapped the database to a named resource pool, you can monitor the performance counter Used Memory (KB) to see how memory usage is growing.  
  
1. Take action to mitigate the potential memory issues. For more information, see [Resolve Out Of Memory Issues](../../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/resolve-out-of-memory-issues.md).
