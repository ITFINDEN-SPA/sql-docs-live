## Arguments

#### [ @publication = ] N'*publication*'

The name of the merge publication to create. *@publication* is **sysname**, with no default, and must not be the keyword `ALL`. The name of the publication must be unique within the database.

#### [ @description = ] N'*description*'

The publication description. *@description* is **nvarchar(255)**, with a default of `NULL`.

#### [ @retention = ] *retention*

The retention period, in retention period units, for which to save changes for the given *@publication*. *@retention* is **int**, with a default of `14`. Retention period units are defined by *@retention_period_unit*. If the subscription isn't synchronized within the retention period, and the pending changes it would have received are removed by a clean-up operation at the Distributor, the subscription expires and must be reinitialized. The maximum allowable retention period is the number of days between December 31, 9999, and the current date.

> [!NOTE]  
> The retention period for merge publications has a 24-hour grace period to accommodate Subscribers in different time zones. If, for example, you set a retention period of one day, the actual retention period is 48 hours.

#### [ @sync_mode = ] N'*sync_mode*'

The mode of the initial synchronization of subscribers to the publication. *@sync_mode* is **nvarchar(10)**, and can be one of the following values.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `native` (default) | Produces native-mode bulk copy program output of all tables. |
| `character` | Produces character-mode bulk copy program output of all tables. Required to support [!INCLUDE [ssEW](../../includes/ssew-md.md)] and non-[!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Subscribers. |

#### [ @allow_push = ] N'*allow_push*'

Specifies if push subscriptions can be created for the given publication. *@allow_push* is **nvarchar(5)**, with a default of `true`, which allows push subscriptions on the publication.

#### [ @allow_pull = ] N'*allow_pull*'

Specifies if pull subscriptions can be created for the given publication. *@allow_pull* is **nvarchar(5)**, with a default of `true`, which allows pull subscriptions on the publication. You must specify true to support [!INCLUDE [ssEW](../../includes/ssew-md.md)] Subscribers.

#### [ @allow_anonymous = ] N'*allow_anonymous*'

Specifies if anonymous subscriptions can be created for the given publication. *@allow_anonymous* is **nvarchar(5)**, with a default of `true`, which allows anonymous subscriptions on the publication. To support [!INCLUDE [ssEW](../../includes/ssew-md.md)] Subscribers, you must specify `true`.

#### [ @enabled_for_internet = ] N'*enabled_for_internet*'

Specifies if the publication is enabled for the Internet, and determines if file transfer protocol (FTP) can be used to transfer the snapshot files to a subscriber. *@enabled_for_internet* is **nvarchar(5)**, with a default of `false`. If `true`, the synchronization files for the publication are put into the `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL\MSSQL.x\Repldata\Ftp` directory. The user must create the Ftp directory. If `false`, the publication isn't enabled for Internet access.

#### [ @centralized_conflicts = ] N'*centralized_conflicts*'

[!INCLUDE [deprecated-parameter](../includes/deprecated-parameter.md)] Use *@conflict_logging* to specify the location where conflict records are stored.

#### [ @dynamic_filters = ] N'*dynamic_filters*'

Enables the merge publication to use parameterized row filters. *@dynamic_filters* is **nvarchar(5)**, with a default of `false`.

> [!NOTE]  
> You shouldn't specify this parameter, but instead allow [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to automatically determine if parameterized row filters are being used. If you specify a value of `true` for *@dynamic_filters*, you must define a parameterized row filter for the article. For more information, see [Define and Modify a Parameterized Row Filter for a Merge Article](../replication/publish/define-and-modify-a-parameterized-row-filter-for-a-merge-article.md).

#### [ @snapshot_in_defaultfolder = ] N'*snapshot_in_defaultfolder*'

Specifies if the snapshot files are stored in the default folder. *@snapshot_in_defaultfolder* is **nvarchar(5)**, with a default of `true`. If `true`, snapshot files can be found in the default folder. If `false`, snapshot files are stored in the alternate location specified by *@alternate_snapshot_folder*. Alternate locations can be on another server, on a network drive, or on a removable media (such as CD-ROM or removable disks). You can also save the snapshot files to a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site, for retrieval by the Subscriber at a later time. This parameter can be true and still have a location specified by *@alt_snapshot_folder*. This combination specifies that the snapshot files are stored in both the default and alternate locations.

#### [ @alt_snapshot_folder = ] N'*alt_snapshot_folder*'

Specifies the location of the alternate folder for the snapshot. *@alt_snapshot_folder* is **nvarchar(255)**, with a default of `NULL`.

#### [ @pre_snapshot_script = ] N'*pre_snapshot_script*'

Specifies a pointer to a `.sql` file location. *@pre_snapshot_script* is **nvarchar(255)**, with a default of `NULL`. The Merge Agent runs the pre-snapshot script before any of the replicated object scripts when applying the snapshot at a Subscriber. The script is executed in the security context used by the Merge Agent when connecting to the subscription database. Pre-snapshot scripts aren't run on [!INCLUDE [ssEW](../../includes/ssew-md.md)] Subscribers.

#### [ @post_snapshot_script = ] N'*post_snapshot_script*'

Specifies a pointer to a `.sql` file location. *@post_snapshot_script* is **nvarchar(255)**, with a default of `NULL`. The Merge Agent will run the post-snapshot script after all the other replicated object scripts and data have been applied during an initial synchronization. The script is executed in the security context used by the Merge Agent when connecting to the subscription database. Post-snapshot scripts aren't run on [!INCLUDE [ssEW](../../includes/ssew-md.md)] Subscribers.

#### [ @compress_snapshot = ] N'*compress_snapshot*'

Specifies that the snapshot written to the *@alt_snapshot_folder* location will be compressed into the [!INCLUDE [msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] CAB format. *@compress_snapshot* is **nvarchar(5)**, with a default of `false`.

- `false` specifies that the snapshot isn't to be compressed.

- `true` specifies that the snapshot will be compressed.

Snapshot files that are larger than 2 GB can't be compressed. Compressed snapshot files are uncompressed at the location where the Merge Agent runs; pull subscriptions are typically used with compressed snapshots so that files are uncompressed at the Subscriber. The snapshot in the default folder can't be compressed. To support [!INCLUDE [ssEW](../../includes/ssew-md.md)] Subscribers, you must specify `false`.

#### [ @ftp_address = ] N'*ftp_address*'

The network address of the FTP service for the Distributor. *@ftp_address* is **sysname**, with a default of `NULL`. Specifies where publication snapshot files are located for the Merge Agent of a subscriber to pick up. Since this property is stored for each publication, each publication can have a different *@ftp_address*. The publication must support propagating snapshots using FTP.

#### [ @ftp_port = ] *ftp_port*

The port number of the FTP service for the Distributor. *@ftp_port* is **int**, with a default of `21`. Specifies where the publication snapshot files are located for the Merge Agent of a subscriber to pick up. Since this property is stored for each publication, each publication can have its own *@ftp_port*.

#### [ @ftp_subdirectory = ] N'*ftp_subdirectory*'

Specifies where the snapshot files are available for the Merge Agent of the subscriber to pick up if the publication supports propagating snapshots using FTP. *@ftp_subdirectory* is **nvarchar(255)**, with a default of `ftp`. Since this property is stored for each publication, each publication can have its own *@ftp_subdirctory* or choose to have no subdirectory, indicated with a `NULL` value.

When pre-generating snapshots for publications with parameterized filters, the data snapshot for each Subscriber partition needs to be in its own folder. The directory structure for pre-generated snapshots using FTP must obey the following structure:

`<alternate_snapshot_folder>\ftp\<publisher_publicationDB_publication>\<partitionID>`.

> [!NOTE]  
> The values in the previous example (in angle-brackets) depend on the specifics of the publication and Subscriber partition.

#### [ @ftp_login = ] N'*ftp_login*'

The username used to connect to the FTP service. *@ftp_login* is **sysname**, with a default of `anonymous`.

#### [ @ftp_password = ] N'*ftp_password*'

The user password used to connect to the FTP service. *@ftp_password* is **sysname**, with a default of `NULL`.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Don't use a blank password. Use a [strong password](../security/strong-passwords.md).

#### [ @conflict_retention = ] *conflict_retention*

Specifies the retention period, in days, for which conflicts are retained. *@conflict_retention* is **int**, with a default of `14` days before the conflict row is purged from the conflict table.

#### [ @keep_partition_changes = ] N'*keep_partition_changes*'

Specifies whether to enable partition change optimizations when precomputed partitions can't be used. *@keep_partition_changes* is **nvarchar(5)**, with a default of `true`.

- `false` means that partition changes aren't optimized, and when precomputed partitions aren't used, the partitions sent to all Subscribers are verified when data changes in a partition.

- `true` means that partition changes are optimized, and only Subscribers having rows in the changed partitions are affected.

When using precomputed partitions, set *@use_partition_groups* to `true` and set *@keep_partition_changes* to `false`. For more information, see [Parameterized Filters - Optimize for Precomputed Partitions](../replication/merge/parameterized-filters-optimize-for-precomputed-partitions.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If you specify a value of `true` for *@keep_partition_changes*, specify a value of `1` for the Snapshot Agent parameter `-MaxNetworkOptimization`. For more information about this parameter, see [Replication Snapshot Agent](../replication/agents/replication-snapshot-agent.md). For information about how to specify agent parameters, see [Replication Agent Administration](../replication/agents/replication-agent-administration.md).

With [!INCLUDE [ssEW](../../includes/ssew-md.md)] subscribers, *@keep_partition_changes* must be set to `true` to ensure that deletes are correctly propagated. When set to `false`, the subscriber might have more rows than expected.

#### [ @allow_subscription_copy = ] N'*allow_subscription_copy*'

Enables or disables the ability to copy the subscription databases that subscribe to this publication. *@allow_subscription_copy* is **nvarchar(5)**, with a default of `false`. The size of the subscription database being copied must be less than 2 GB.

#### [ @allow_synctoalternate = ] N'*allow_synctoalternate*'

[!INCLUDE [ssInternalOnly](../../includes/ssinternalonly-md.md)]

#### [ @validate_subscriber_info = ] N'*validate_subscriber_info*'

Lists the functions that are used to define a Subscriber partition of the published data when parameterized row filters are used. *@validate_subscriber_info* is **nvarchar(500)**, with a default of `NULL`. This information is used by the Merge Agent to validate the Subscriber's partition. For example, if [SUSER_SNAME](../../t-sql/functions/suser-sname-transact-sql.md) is used in the parameterized row filter, the parameter should be `@validate_subscriber_info=N'SUSER_SNAME()`.

> [!NOTE]  
> You shouldn't specify this parameter, but instead allow [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to automatically determine the filtering criterion.

#### [ @add_to_active_directory = ] N'*add_to_active_directory*'

[!INCLUDE [deprecated-parameter](../includes/deprecated-parameter.md)] You can no longer add publication information to the [!INCLUDE [msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Active Directory.

#### [ @max_concurrent_merge = ] *max_concurrent_merge*

The maximum number of concurrent merge processes. *@max_concurrent_merge* is **int**, with a default of `0`. A value of `0` for means that there's no limit to the number of concurrent merge processes running at any given time.

This property sets a limit on the number of concurrent merge processes that can be run against a merge publication at one time. If there are more merge processes scheduled at the same time than the value allowed to run, then the excess jobs are put into a queue, and wait until a currently running merge process finishes.

#### [ @max_concurrent_dynamic_snapshots = ] *max_concurrent_dynamic_snapshots*

The maximum number of Snapshot Agent sessions that can be run concurrently to generate filtered data snapshots for Subscriber partitions. *@max_concurrent_dynamic_snapshots* is **int**, with a default of `0`. If `0`, there's no limit to the number snapshot sessions. If there are more snapshot processes scheduled at the same time than the value allowed to run, then the excess jobs are put into a queue, and wait until a currently running snapshot process finishes.

#### [ @use_partition_groups = ] N'*use_partition_groups*'

Specifies that precomputed partitions should be used to optimize the synchronization process. *@use_partition_groups* is **nvarchar(5)**, and can be one of these values:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `true` | Publication uses precomputed partitions. |
| `false` | Publication doesn't use precomputed partitions. |
| `NULL` (default) | System decides on the partitioning strategy. |

Precomputed partitions are used by default. To avoid using precomputed partitions, *@use_partition_groups* must be set to `false`. When `NULL`, the system decides if precomputed partitions can be used. If precomputed partitions can't be used, then this value effectively becomes `false` without generating any errors. In such cases, *@keep_partition_changes* can be set to `true` to provide some optimization. For more information, see [Parameterized Filters - Parameterized Row Filters](../replication/merge/parameterized-filters-parameterized-row-filters.md) and [Parameterized Filters - Optimize for Precomputed Partitions](../replication/merge/parameterized-filters-optimize-for-precomputed-partitions.md).

#### [ @publication_compatibility_level = ] N'*publication_compatibility_level*'

Indicates the backward compatibility of the publication. *@publication_compatibility_level* is **nvarchar(6)**, and can be one of these values:

| Value | Version |
| --- | --- |
| `90RTM` | [!INCLUDE [ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] |
| `100RTM` | [!INCLUDE [sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] |

#### [ @replicate_ddl = ] *replicate_ddl*

Indicates if schema replication is supported for the publication. *@replicate_ddl* is **int**, with a default of `NULL`. `1` indicates that data definition language (DDL) statements executed at the publisher are replicated, and `0` indicates that DDL statements aren't replicated. For more information, see [Make Schema Changes on Publication Databases](../replication/publish/make-schema-changes-on-publication-databases.md).

The *@replicate_ddl* parameter is honored when a DDL statement adds a column. The *@replicate_ddl* parameter is ignored when a DDL statement alters or drops a column for the following reasons.

- When a column is dropped, `sysarticlecolumns` must be updated to prevent new DML statements from including the dropped column that would cause the distribution agent to fail. The *@replicate_ddl* parameter is ignored because replication must always replicate the schema change.

- When a column is altered, the source data type or nullability might have changed, causing DML statements to contain a value that might not be compatible with the table at the subscriber. Such DML statements might cause distribution agent to fail. The *@replicate_ddl* parameter is ignored because replication must always replicate the schema change.

- When a DDL statement adds a new column, `sysarticlecolumns` doesn't include the new column. DML statements don't try to replicate data for the new column. The parameter is honored because either replicating or not replicating the DDL is acceptable.

#### [ @allow_subscriber_initiated_snapshot = ] N'*allow_subscriber_initiated_snapshot*'

Indicates if Subscribers to this publication can initiate the snapshot process to generate the filtered snapshot for their data partition. *@allow_subscriber_initiated_snapshot* is **nvarchar(5)**, with a default of `false`. `true` indicates that Subscribers can initiate the snapshot process.

#### [ @allow_web_synchronization = ] N'*allow_web_synchronization*'

Specifies if the publication is enabled for Web synchronization. *@allow_web_synchronization* is **nvarchar(5)**, with a default of `false`. `true` specifies that subscriptions to this publication can be synchronized over HTTPS. For more information, see [Web Synchronization for Merge Replication](../replication/web-synchronization-for-merge-replication.md). To support [!INCLUDE [ssEW](../../includes/ssew-md.md)] Subscribers, you must specify `true`.

#### [ @web_synchronization_url = ] N'*web_synchronization_url*'

Specifies the default value of the Internet URL used for Web synchronization. *@web_synchronization_url* is **nvarchar(500)**, with a default of `NULL`. Defines the default Internet URL if one isn't explicitly set when [sp_addmergepullsubscription_agent](sp-addmergepullsubscription-agent-transact-sql.md) is executed.

#### [ @allow_partition_realignment = ] N'*allow_partition_realignment*'

Determines whether deletes are sent to the subscriber when modification of the row on the publisher causes it to change its partition. *@allow_partition_realignment* is **nvarchar(5)**, with a default of `true`.

- `true` sends deletes to the Subscriber to reflect the results of a partition change by removing data that is no longer part of the Subscriber's partition.

- `false` leaves the data from an old partition on the Subscriber, where changes made to this data on the Publisher don't replicate to this Subscriber, but changes made on the Subscriber replicate to the Publisher.

Setting *@allow_partition_realignment* to `false` is used to retain data in a subscription from an old partition when the data needs to be accessible for historical purposes.

> [!NOTE]  
> Data that remains at the Subscriber as a result of setting *@allow_partition_realignment* to `false` should be treated as if it were read-only; however, this isn't enforced by the replication system.

#### [ @retention_period_unit = ] N'*retention_period_unit*'

Specifies the units for the retention period set by *@retention*. *@retention_period_unit* is **nvarchar(10)**, and can be one of the following values.

| Value | Version |
| --- | --- |
| `day` (default) | Retention period is specified in days. |
| `week` | Retention period is specified in weeks. |
| `month` | Retention period is specified in months. |
| `year` | Retention period is specified in years. |

#### [ @generation_leveling_threshold = ] *generation_leveling_threshold*

Specifies the number of changes that are contained in a generation. A generation is a collection of changes that are delivered to a Publisher or Subscriber. *@generation_leveling_threshold* is **int**, with a default of `1000`.

#### [ @automatic_reinitialization_policy = ] *automatic_reinitialization_policy*

Specifies whether changes are uploaded from the Subscriber before an automatic reinitialization required by a change to the publication, where a value of `1` was specified for *@force_reinit_subscription*. *@automatic_reinitialization_policy* is **bit**, with a default of `0`.

`1` means that changes are uploaded from the Subscriber before an automatic reinitialization occurs.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you add, drop, or change a parameterized filter, pending changes at the Subscriber can't be uploaded to the Publisher during reinitialization. If you want to upload pending changes, synchronize all subscriptions before changing the filter.

#### [ @conflict_logging = ] N'*conflict_logging*'

Specifies where conflict records are stored. *@conflict_logging* is **nvarchar(15)**, and can be one of the following values:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `publisher` | Conflict records are stored at the Publisher. |
| `subscriber` | Conflict records are stored at the Subscriber that caused the conflict. Not supported for [!INCLUDE [ssEW](../../includes/ssew-md.md)] Subscribers. |
| `both` | Conflict records are stored at both the Publisher and Subscriber. |
| `NULL` (default) | Replication automatically sets *@conflict_logging* to `both` when the value *@publication_compatibility_level* is `90RTM` and to `publisher` in all other cases. |

## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Remarks

`sp_addmergepublication` is used in merge replication.

To list publication objects to the Active Directory using the *@add_to_active_directory* parameter, the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] object must already be created in the Active Directory.

If multiple publications exist that publish the same database object, only publications with a *@replicate_ddl* value of `1` replicate `ALTER TABLE`, `ALTER VIEW`, `ALTER PROCEDURE`, `ALTER FUNCTION`, and `ALTER TRIGGER` DDL statements. However, an `ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN` DDL statement will be replicated by all publications that are publishing the dropped column.

For [!INCLUDE [ssEW](../../includes/ssew-md.md)] Subscribers, the value of *@alternate_snapshot_folder* is only used when the value of *@snapshot_in_default_folder* is `false`.

With DDL replication enabled (`@replicate_ddl = 1`) for a publication, in order to make non-replicating DDL changes to the publication, [sp_changemergepublication (Transact-SQL)](sp-changemergepublication-transact-sql.md) must first be executed to set *@replicate_ddl* to `0`. After the non-replicating DDL statements have been issued, `sp_changemergepublication` can be run again to turn DDL replication back on.
