# sp_addrolemember (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

Adds a database user, database role, Windows login, or Windows group to a database role in the current database.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> [!INCLUDE [ssNoteDepFutureAvoid](../../includes/ssnotedepfutureavoid-md.md)] Use [ALTER ROLE](../../t-sql/statements/alter-role-transact-sql.md) instead.

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sp_addrolemember
    [ @rolename = ] N'rolename'
    , [ @membername = ] N'membername'
[ ; ]
```

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [synapse-analytics-od-unsupported-syntax](../../includes/synapse-analytics-od-unsupported-syntax.md)]

## Arguments

#### [ @rolename = ] N'*rolename*'

The name of the database role in the current database. *@rolename* is **sysname**, with no default.

#### [ @membername = ] N'*membername*'

The security account being added to the role. *@membername* is **sysname**, with no default. *@membername* can be a database user, database role, Windows login, or Windows group.

## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Remarks

A member added to a role by using `sp_addrolemember` inherits the permissions of the role. If the new member is a Windows-level principal without a corresponding database user, a database user is created, but might not be fully mapped to the login. Always check that the login exists and has access to the database.

A role can't include itself as a member. Such *circular* definitions aren't valid, even when membership is indirectly implied by one or more intermediate memberships.

`sp_addrolemember` can't add a fixed database role, fixed server role, or **dbo** to a role.

Only use `sp_addrolemember` to add a member to a database role. To add a member to a server role, use [sp_addsrvrolemember (Transact-SQL)](sp-addsrvrolemember-transact-sql.md).

## Permissions

Adding members to flexible database roles requires one of the following permissions:

- Membership in the **db_securityadmin** or **db_owner** fixed database role.

- Membership in the role that owns the role.

- `ALTER ANY ROLE` permission or `ALTER` permission on the role.

Adding members to fixed database roles requires membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role.

## Examples

### A. Add a Windows login

The following example adds the Windows login `Contoso\Mary5` to the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database as user `Mary5`. The user `Mary5` is then added to the `Production` role.

Because `Contoso\Mary5` is known as the database user `Mary5` in the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database, the user name `Mary5` must be specified. The statement fails unless a `Contoso\Mary5` login exists. Test by using a login from your domain.

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO
CREATE USER Mary5 FOR LOGIN [Contoso\Mary5];
GO
```

### B. Add a database user

The following example adds the database user `Mary5` to the `Production` database role in the current database.

```sql
EXEC sp_addrolemember 'Production', 'Mary5';
```

## Examples: [!INCLUDE [ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)]

### C. Add a Windows login

The following example adds the login `LoginMary` to the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database as user `UserMary`. The user `UserMary` is then added to the `Production` role.

> [!NOTE]  
> Because the login `LoginMary` is known as the database user `UserMary` in the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database, the user name `UserMary` must be specified. The statement will fail unless a `Mary5` login exists. Logins and users usually have the same name. This example uses different names to differentiate the actions affecting the login vs. the user.

```sql
-- Uses AdventureWorks2022
CREATE USER UserMary FOR LOGIN LoginMary;
GO
EXEC sp_addrolemember 'Production', 'UserMary'
```

### D. Add a database user

The following example adds the database user `UserMary` to the `Production` database role in the current database.

```sql
EXEC sp_addrolemember 'Production', 'UserMary'
```
