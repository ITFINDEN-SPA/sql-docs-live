# sp_addpushsubscription_agent (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

Adds a new scheduled agent job used to synchronize a push subscription to a transactional publication. This stored procedure is executed at the Publisher on the publication database.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When configuring a Publisher with a remote Distributor, the values supplied for all parameters, including *job_login* and *job_password*, are sent to the Distributor as plain text. You should encrypt the connection between the Publisher and its remote Distributor before executing this stored procedure. For more information, see [Configure SQL Server Database Engine for encrypting connections](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-sql-server-encryption.md).

## Arguments

#### [ @publication = ] N'*publication*'

The name of the publication. *@publication* is **sysname**, with no default.

#### [ @subscriber = ] N'*subscriber*'

The name of the Subscriber instance, or the name of the AG listener if the subscriber database is part of an availability group. *@subscriber* is **sysname**, with a default of `NULL`.

<!--SQL Server 2019 on Linux-->
::: moniker range=">= sql-server-linux-ver15 || >= sql-server-ver15 "
[!INCLUDE [custom-port](includes/custom-port.md)]
::: moniker-end

#### [ @subscriber_db = ] N'*subscriber_db*'

The name of the subscription database. *@subscriber_db* is **sysname**, with a default of `NULL`.

For a non-SQL Server Subscriber, specify a value of **(default destination)** for *subscriber_db*.

#### [ @subscriber_security_mode = ] *subscriber_security_mode*

[!INCLUDE [entra-id](../../includes/entra-id.md)]

The security mode to use when connecting to a Subscriber when synchronizing. *@subscriber_security_mode* is **smallint**, with a default of `1`. The following values define the security mode:

- `0` specifies [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] authentication.
- `1` specifies Windows authentication.

- `4` specifies Microsoft Entra token authentication starting with [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] CU 6.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For queued updating subscriptions, use [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication for connections to Subscribers, and specify a different account for the connection to each Subscriber. For all other subscriptions, use Windows Authentication.

#### [ @subscriber_login = ] N'*subscriber_login*'

The Subscriber login to use when connecting to a Subscriber when synchronizing. *@subscriber_login* is **sysname**, with a default of `NULL`.

#### [ @subscriber_password = ] N'*subscriber_password*'

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> [!INCLUDE [ssnotestrongpass-md](../../includes/ssnotestrongpass-md.md)] When possible, prompt users to enter security credentials at runtime. If you must store credentials in a script file, you must secure the file to prevent unauthorized access.

#### [ @job_login = ] N'*job_login*'

The login for the account under which the agent runs. On Azure SQL Managed Instance, use a SQL Server account. *@job_login* is **nvarchar(257)**, with a default of `NULL`.

#### [ @job_name = ] N'*job_name*'

The name of an existing agent job. *@job_name* is **sysname**, with a default of `NULL`. This parameter is only specified when the subscription is synchronized using an existing job, instead of a newly created job (the default).

> [!NOTE]  
> Specifying a value of `64` causes the Distribution Agent to run in continuous mode. This corresponds to setting the `-Continuous` parameter for the agent. For more information, see [Replication Distribution Agent](../replication/agents/replication-distribution-agent.md).

#### [ @frequency_interval = ] *frequency_interval*

The value to apply to the frequency set by *@frequency_type*. *@frequency_interval* is **int**, with a default of `1`.
