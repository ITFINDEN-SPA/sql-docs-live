# jobs.sp_delete_job (Azure Elastic Jobs) (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [Azure SQL Database](../../includes/applies-to-version/asdb.md)]

Deletes an existing job in the [Azure Elastic Jobs service for Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/elastic-jobs-overview?view=azuresql-db&preserve-view=true).

This stored procedure shares the name of `sp_delete_job` with a similar object in [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] for the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service. For information about the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent version, see [sp_delete_job (Transact-SQL)](sp-delete-job-transact-sql.md).

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
[ jobs ] .sp_delete_job
    [ @job_name = ] N'job_name'
    [ , [ @force = ] force ]
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @job_name = ] N'*job_name*'

The name of the job to be deleted. *@job_name* is **nvarchar(128)**, with a default of `NULL`.

#### [ @force = ] *force*

Forces the job to be deleted. *@force* is **bit**.

- When `1`, forces the job to be deleted, even if executions are currently in progress, canceling any executions currently in progress.
- When `0`, fails if any job executions are in progress.

## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Remarks

Job history is automatically deleted when a job is deleted.

To remove only a single job step from an existing job, use [jobs.sp_delete_jobstep (Azure Elastic Jobs) (Transact-SQL)](sp-delete-jobstep-elastic-jobs-transact-sql.md).

## Permissions

By default, members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can execute this stored procedure. Only members of sysadmin can use this stored procedure to edit the attributes of jobs owned by other users.
