# sp_replmonitorhelppublication (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

Returns current status information for one or more publications at a Publisher. This stored procedure, which is used to monitor replication, is executed at the Distributor on the distribution database.

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sp_replmonitorhelppublication
    [ [ @publisher = ] N'publisher' ]
    [ , [ @publisher_db = ] N'publisher_db' ]
    [ , [ @publication = ] N'publication' ]
    [ , [ @publication_type = ] publication_type ]
    [ , [ @refreshpolicy = ] refreshpolicy ]
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @publisher = ] N'*publisher*'

The name of the Publisher the status of which is being monitored. *@publisher* is **sysname**, with a default of `NULL`. If `NULL`, information is returned for all Publishers that use the Distributor.

#### [ @publisher_db = ] N'*publisher_db*'

The name of the published database. *@publisher_db* is **sysname**, with a default of `NULL`. If `NULL`, then information is returned for all published databases at the Publisher.

#### [ @publication = ] N'*publication*'

The name of the publication being monitored. *@publication* is **sysname**, with a default of `NULL`.

#### [ @publication_type = ] *publication_type*

The type of publication. *@publication_type* is **int**, and can be one of these values.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Transactional publication. |
| `1` | Snapshot publication. |
| `2` | Merge publication. |
| `NULL` (default) | Replication attempts to determine the publication type. |

#### [ @refreshpolicy = ] *refreshpolicy*

[!INCLUDE [ssinternalonly-md](../../includes/ssinternalonly-md.md)]

| `publication` | **sysname** | The name of a publication. |
| `publication_type` | **int** | The type of publication, and can be one of these values.<br /><br />`0` = Transactional publication<br /><br />`1` = Snapshot publication<br /><br />`2` = Merge publication |
| `status` | **int** | Maximum status of all replication agents associated with the publication, and can be one of these values.<br /><br />`1` = Started<br /><br />`2` = Succeeded<br /><br />`3` = In progress<br /><br />`4` = Idle<br /><br />`5` = Retrying<br /><br />`6` = Failed |
| `warning` | **int** | Maximum threshold warning generated by a subscription belonging to the publication, and can be the logical OR result of one or more of these values.<br /><br />`1` = expiration - a subscription to a transactional publication hasn't been synchronized within the retention period threshold.<br /><br />`2` = latency - the time taken to replicate data from a transactional Publisher to the Subscriber exceeds the threshold, in seconds.<br /><br />`4` = mergeexpiration - a subscription to a merge publication hasn't been synchronized within the retention period threshold.<br /><br />`8` = mergefastrunduration - the time taken to complete synchronization of a merge subscription exceeds the threshold, in seconds, over a fast network connection.<br /><br />`16` = mergeslowrunduration - the time taken to complete synchronization of a merge subscription exceeds the threshold, in seconds, over a slow network connection.<br /><br />`32` = mergefastrunspeed - the delivery rate for rows during synchronization of a merge subscription has failed to maintain the threshold rate, in rows per second, over a fast network connection.<br /><br />`64` = mergeslowrunspeed - the delivery rate for rows during synchronization of a merge subscription has failed to maintain the threshold rate, in rows per second, over a slow network connection. |
| `worst_latency` | **int** | The highest latency, in seconds, for data changes propagated by the Log Reader or Distribution Agents for a transactional publication. |
| `best_latency` | **int** | The lowest latency, in seconds, for data changes propagated by the Log Reader or Distribution Agents for a transactional publication. |
| `average_latency` | **int** | The average latency, in seconds, for data changes propagated by the Log Reader or Distribution Agents for a transactional publication. |
| `last_distsync` | **datetime** | The last datetime that the Distribution Agent ran. |
| `retention` | **int** | The retention period for the publication. |
| `latencythreshold` | **int** | The latency threshold set for the transactional publication. |
| `expirationthreshold` | **int** | The expiration threshold set for the publication if it's a merge publication. |
| `agentnotrunningthreshold` | **int** | The threshold set for the longest time for an agent not to have run. |
| `subscriptioncount` | **int** | The number of subscriptions to a publication. |
| `runningdistagentcount` | **int** | The number of distribution agents running for the publication |
| `snapshot_agentname` | **sysname** | The name of the Snapshot Agent job for the publication. |
| `logreader_agentname` | **sysname** | The name of the Log Reader Agent job for the transactional publication. |
| `qreader_agentname` | **sysname** | The name of the Queue Reader Agent job for a transactional publication that supports queued updating. |
| `worst_runspeedPerf` | **int** | The longest synchronization time for the merge publication. |
| `best_runspeedPerf` | **int** | The shortest synchronization time for the merge publication. |
| `average_runspeedPerf` | **int** | The average synchronization time for the merge publication. |
| `retention_period_unit` | **int** | The unit used to express *retention*. |
| `publisher` | **sysname** | The name of the instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] publishing the publication. |

## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Remarks

`sp_replmonitorhelppublication` is used with all types of replication.

## Permissions

Only members of the **db_owner** or **replmonitor** fixed database role on the distribution database can execute `sp_replmonitorhelppublication`.
