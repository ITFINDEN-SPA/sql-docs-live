| `pubid` | **uniqueidentifier** | Unique identifier of this publication. |
| `snapshot_jobid` | **binary(16)** | Job ID of the Snapshot Agent. To obtain the entry for the snapshot job in the [sysjobs](../system-tables/dbo-sysjobs-transact-sql.md) system table, you must convert this hexadecimal value to **uniqueidentifier**. |
| `enabled_for_internet` | **int** | Determines whether the publication is enabled for the Internet. If `1`, the synchronization files for the publication are put into the `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL\Repldata\Ftp` directory. The user must create the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) directory. If `0`, the publication isn't enabled for Internet access. |

| `snapshot_in_default_folder` | **bit** | Specifies if the snapshot files are stored in the default folder.<br /><br />If `1`, snapshot files can be found in the default folder.<br /><br />If `0`, snapshot files are stored in the alternate location specified by `alt_snapshot_folder`. Alternate locations can be on another server, on a network drive, or on a removable media (such as CD-ROM or removable disks). You can also save the snapshot files to an FTP site, for retrieval by the Subscriber at a later time.<br /><br />Note: This parameter can be true and still have a location in the `alt_snapshot_folder` parameter. That combination specifies that the snapshot files are stored in both the default and alternate locations. |

| `compress_snapshot` | **bit** | Specifies that the snapshot that is written to the `alt_snapshot_folder` location is compressed into the [!INCLUDE [msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] CAB format. |
| `ftp_address` | **sysname** | The network address of the FTP service for the Distributor. Specifies where publication snapshot files are located for the Merge Agent to pick up. |
| `ftp_port` | **int** | The port number of the FTP service for the Distributor. `ftp_port` has a default of `21`. Specifies where the publication snapshot files are located for the Merge Agent to pick up. |

| `ftp_login` | **sysname** | The username used to connect to the FTP service. |

| `keep_partition_changes` | **int** | Specifies whether synchronization optimization is occurring for this publication. `keep_partition_changes` has a default of `0`. A value of `0` means that synchronization isn't optimized, and the partitions sent to all Subscribers are verified when data changes in a partition.<br /><br />`1` means that synchronization is optimized, and only Subscribers having rows in the changed partition are affected.<br /><br />Note: By default, merge publications use precomputed partitions, which provide a greater degree of optimization than this option. For more information, see [Parameterized Filters - Parameterized Row Filters](../replication/merge/parameterized-filters-parameterized-row-filters.md) and [Parameterized Filters - Optimize for Precomputed Partitions](../replication/merge/parameterized-filters-optimize-for-precomputed-partitions.md). |

| `max_concurrent_dynamic_snapshots` | **int** | The maximum number of concurrent filtered data snapshot sessions that can be running against the merge publication. If `0`, there's no limit to the maximum number of concurrent filtered data snapshot sessions that can run simultaneously against the publication at any given time. |
