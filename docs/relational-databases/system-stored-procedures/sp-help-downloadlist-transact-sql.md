## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sp_help_downloadlist
    [ [ @job_id = ] 'job_id' ]
    [ , [ @job_name = ] N'job_name' ]
    [ , [ @operation = ] 'operation' ]
    [ , [ @object_type = ] 'object_type' ]
    [ , [ @object_name = ] N'object_name' ]
    [ , [ @target_server = ] N'target_server' ]
    [ , [ @has_error = ] has_error ]
    [ , [ @status = ] status ]
    [ , [ @date_posted = ] date_posted ]
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @job_id = ] '*job_id*'

The job identification number for which to return information. *@job_id* is **uniqueidentifier**, with a default of `NULL`.

Either *@job_id* or *@job_name* must be specified, but both can't be specified.

#### [ @job_name = ] N'*job_name*'

The name of the job. *@job_name* is **sysname**, with a default of `NULL`.

Either *@job_id* or *@job_name* must be specified, but both can't be specified.

#### [ @operation = ] '*operation*'

The valid operation for the specified job. *@operation* is **varchar(64)**, and can be one of these values.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DEFECT` | Server operation that requests the target server to defect from the Master [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service. |
| `DELETE` | Job operation that removes an entire job. |
| `INSERT` | Job operation that inserts an entire job or refreshes an existing job. This operation includes all job steps and schedules, if applicable. |
| `RE-ENLIST` | Server operation that causes the target server to resend its enlistment information, including the polling interval and time zone to the multiserver domain. The target server also redownloads the `MSXOperator` details. |
| `SET-POLL` | Server operation that sets the interval, in seconds, for target servers to poll the multiserver domain. If specified, *@value* is interpreted as the required interval value, and can be a value from 10 to 28,800. |
| `START` | Job operation that requests the start of job execution. |
| `STOP` | Job operation that requests the stop of job execution. |
| `SYNC-TIME` | Server operation that causes the target server to synchronize its system clock with the multiserver domain. Because this is a costly operation, perform this operation on a limited, infrequent basis. |
| `UPDATE` | Job operation that updates only the `sysjobs` information for a job, not the job steps or schedules. Is automatically called by `sp_update_job`. |

#### [ @object_type = ] '*object_type*'

The type of object for the specified job. *@object_type* is **varchar(64)**, with a default of `NULL`. *@object_type* can be either `JOB` or `SERVER`. For more information about valid *@object_type*values, see [sp_add_category](sp-add-category-transact-sql.md).

#### [ @object_name = ] N'*object_name*'

The name of the object. *@object_name* is **sysname**, with a default of `NULL`. If *@object_type* is `JOB`, *@object_name* is the job name. If *@object_type* is `SERVER`, *@object_name* is the server name.

#### [ @target_server = ] N'*target_server*'

The name of the target server. *@target_server* is **sysname**, with a default of `NULL`.

#### [ @has_error = ] *has_error*

Specifies whether the job should acknowledge errors. *@has_error* is **tinyint**, with a default of `NULL`, which indicates no errors should be acknowledged. `1` indicates that all errors should be acknowledged.

#### [ @status = ] *status*

The status for the job. *@status* is **tinyint**, with a default of `NULL`.

#### [ @date_posted = ] *date_posted*

The date and time for which all entries made on or after the specified date and time should be included in the result set. *@date_posted* is **datetime**, with a default of `NULL`.

## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Result set

| Column name | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `instance_id` | **int** | Unique integer identification number of the instruction. |
| `source_server` | **nvarchar(30)** | Computer name of the server the instruction came from. |
| `operation_code` | **nvarchar(4000)** | Operation code for the instruction. |
| `object_name` | **sysname** | Object affected by the instruction. |
| `object_id` | **uniqueidentifier** | Identification number of the object affected by the instruction (`job_id` for a job object, or `0x00` for a server object) or a data value specific to the `operation_code`. |
| `target_server` | **nvarchar(30)** | Target server that this instruction should be downloaded by. |
| `error_message` | **nvarchar(1024)** | Error message (if any) from the target server if it encountered a problem while processing this instruction.<br /><br />Note: Any error message blocks all further downloads by the target server. |
| `date_posted` | **datetime** | Date the instruction was posted to the table. |
| `date_downloaded` | **datetime** | Date the target server downloaded the instruction. |
| `status` | **tinyint** | Status of the job:<br /><br />`0` = Not yet downloaded<br />`1` = Successfully downloaded. |

## Permissions

Permissions to execute this procedure default to members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role.

## Examples

The following example lists rows in the `sysdownloadlist` for the `NightlyBackups` job.

```sql
USE msdb;
GO

EXEC dbo.sp_help_downloadlist
    @job_name = N'NightlyBackups',
    @operation = N'UPDATE',
    @object_type = N'JOB',
    @object_name = N'NightlyBackups',
    @target_server = N'SEATTLE2',
    @has_error = 1,
    @status = NULL,
    @date_posted = NULL;
GO
