# UPDATE statement limitations

For the Paradox driver to update a table, the table must have a unique index (Paradox primary key). When you use the Paradox driver without implementing the Borland Database Engine, it's not possible to update a Paradox table.

Not supported by the Text driver.

When the Microsoft Excel driver is used, it's possible to update values, but a row can't be deleted from a table based on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. As a result, the UPDATE statement isn't considered officially supported by the Microsoft Excel driver. Only the `INSERT` statement is considered supported.
