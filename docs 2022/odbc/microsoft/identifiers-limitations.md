# Identifiers limitations

If an identifier contains a space or a special symbol, the identifier must be enclosed in back quotes. A valid name is a string of no more than 64 characters, of which the first character must not be a space. Valid names can't include control characters or the following special characters: `` ` ``, `|`, `#`, `*`, `?`, `[`, `]`, `.`, `!`, or `$`.

Don't use the reserved words listed in the SQL grammar in Appendix C of the *ODBC Programmer's Reference* (or the shorthand form of these reserved words) as identifiers (that is, table or column names), unless you surround the word in back quotes (`` ` ``).
