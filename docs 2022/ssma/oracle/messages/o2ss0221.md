# O2SS0221: Call to identity sequence NEXTVAL not supported (Error)

This article covers some of the reasons why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle doesn't convert procedures with reference to sequence's `NEXTVAL` function.

## Background

A `SEQUENCE` is an independent database object in Oracle, which automatically creates unique integers typically for primary key/foreign values. A `NEXTVAL` is used to access the next value of the specified sequence.

When converting `SEQUENCE` objects, SSMA can use two techniques, namely **Sequence to Sequence**, and **Sequence to Identity**. When SSMA converts to sequence, it creates a corresponding `SEQUENCE` object in the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] schema for each Oracle sequence. In the **Sequence to Identity** mode, SSMA doesn't create any `SEQUENCE` objects in [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] thus calls to `NEXTVAL` for the Oracle sequence results in an error message.

## Example

Consider the following example:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE proc1
AS
    t1 NUMBER;
BEGIN
    SELECT customers_seq.NEXTVAL INTO t1 FROM DUAL;
END;
```

Here we have a stored procedure that attempts to retrieve next value for the sequence `customers_seq`. If **Sequence to Identity** mode is used in SSMA, then the following error message is produced:

> O2SS0221: Call to identity sequence NEXTVAL not supported

## Possible remedies

To resolve this error, either rewrite the PL/SQL code to eliminate access to `NEXTVAL`, or change the SSMA project settings to produce `SEQUENCE` objects in [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], instead of identity columns. To do the later:

1. Select the **Tools** menu and select **Project Settings**.
1. Then, select the **General** tab.
1. Now, under **Sequence conversion** group set **Convert Sequence Generator** to **Using SQL Server sequence generator**.
1. Apply these settings and select **OK**.
