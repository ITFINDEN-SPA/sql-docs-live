# Create a basic table report (SSRS tutorial)

This tutorial is a six-step process that helps you create a SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) paginated report. You learn how to use the Report Designer tool in Visual Studio/SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) to create a query table from data in the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.

The six parts in this tutorial show you how to:
  
- Create a report project.
- Set up a data connection.
- Define a query.
- Add a table data region.
- Format the report.
- Group and total fields.
- Preview the report.
- Publish the report.

## Prerequisites

Install or configure the following components and permissions:

- [!INCLUDE[msconame-md](../includes/msconame-md.md)] SQL Server database engine.  
- SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services or later (SSRS).
- The [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database. For more information, see [Adventure Works Sample Databases](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases).
- [SQL Server Data Tools](../ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt.md) for Visual Studio and the Reporting Services extension for access to the *Report Designer*.
- Read-only permissions to retrieve data from the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.

**Estimated time to complete the tutorial**: 30 minutes.
