# Remove a rendering extension
  To remove a [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] rendering extension, remove the **Extension** element for your rendering extension from the rsreportserver.config file, located in the ``%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft SQL Server\MSRS10_50.\<Instance Name>\Reporting Services\ReportServer`` folder. If you made entries for a Report Designer and a report server, remove the **Extension** element from the [RSReportDesigner configuration file](../../../reporting-services/report-server/rsreportdesigner-configuration-file.md) as well. After the configuration information is removed, the rendering extension is no longer available to the component.
