# Automatically connect your SQL Server to Azure Arc

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

This article explains how to connect your SQL Server instance to Azure Arc.

[!INCLUDE [azure-vmware](includes/azure-vmware.md)]

Before you proceed, complete the [Prerequisites](prerequisites.md).

## Steps

1. [Onboard the server to Azure Arc](#onboard-the-server-to-azure-arc)
1. Wait approximately 10 minutes
1. [Verify your [!INCLUDE [ssazurearc](../../includes/ssazurearc.md)] resources](#verify-your-resources)

## Onboard the server to Azure Arc

To connect your SQL Server to Azure, see [Azure Connected Machine agent deployment options](/azure/azure-arc/servers/deployment-options).

> [!NOTE]  
> If your server is already connected to Azure, but Azure extension for SQL Server is not deployed automatically using above methods, proceed to [Alternate deployment options for SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc](deployment-options.md) to connect SQL Server to Azure.

Azure Arc automatically installs the Azure extension for SQL Server when a server connected to Azure Arc has SQL Server installed. All the SQL Server instance resources are automatically created in Azure. These provide a centralized management platform for all your SQL Server instances.

To learn more, see [Auto deployment of Azure extension for SQL Server](manage-autodeploy.md).

## Verify your resources

In Azure portal, go to **Azure Arc > SQL Server** and open the newly registered Arc-enabled SQL Server resource to validate.

> [!NOTE]  
> After connecting the server to Arc, you need to wait 10 minutes for the Azure extension for SQL Server to deploy and the Arc-enabled SQL Server resource to be created.
>

If the Arc-enabled SQL Server resource does not appear in the same resource group as the Arc Server, follow the [Azure extension for SQL Server](troubleshoot-deployment.md) guide to troubleshoot the issue.

Use this page in the portal to review current information about a [!INCLUDE [ssazurearc](../../includes/ssazurearc.md)]. For example:

- The last time usage data is uploaded to Azure
- Azure extension for SQL Server version
- Provisioning state
- Automatic upgrade status
- The last time that inventory was reported

## Evaluate on an Azure VM

Normally, you wouldn't use [!INCLUDE [ssazurearc](../../includes/ssazurearc.md)] on an Azure virtual machine. However, you can use an Azure SQL Virtual machine to evaluate Arc-enabled SQL Server on an Azure VM.

To test Arc-enabled SQL Server on an Azure VM, follow the steps at [Evaluate Arc-enabled servers on an Azure virtual machine](/azure/azure-arc/servers/plan-evaluate-on-azure-virtual-machine). For the Azure VM image, use an [available Azure SQL VM image](/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/sql-vm-create-portal-quickstart).
