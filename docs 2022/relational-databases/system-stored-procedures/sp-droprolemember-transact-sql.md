## Syntax

Syntax for [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [ssazurede-md](../../includes/ssazurede-md.md)]:

```syntaxsql
sp_droprolemember
    [ @rolename = ] N'rolename'
    , [ @membername = ] N'membername'
[ ; ]
```

Syntax for Azure Synapse Analytics and Parallel Data Warehouse:

```syntaxsql
sp_droprolemember N'rolename', 'membername'
[ ; ]
```

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [synapse-analytics-od-unsupported-syntax](../../includes/synapse-analytics-od-unsupported-syntax.md)]

## Arguments

#### [ @rolename = ] N'*rolename*'

The name of the role from which the member is being removed. *@rolename* is **sysname**, with no default. *@rolename* must exist in the current database.

#### [ @membername = ] N'*membername*'

The name of the security account being removed from the role. *@membername* is **sysname**, with no default. *@membername* can be a database user, another database role, a Windows account, or a Windows group. *@membername* must exist in the current database.

## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Remarks

`sp_droprolemember` removes a member from a database role by deleting a row from the `sysmembers` table. When a member is removed from a role, the member loses any permissions it has by membership in that role.

To remove a user from a fixed server role, use `sp_dropsrvrolemember`. Users can't be removed from the public role, and dbo can't be removed from any role.

Use `sp_helpuser` to see the members of a [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] role, and use ALTER ROLE to add a member to a role.

## Permissions

Requires `ALTER` permission on the role.

## Examples

The following example removes the user `JonB` from the role `Sales`.

```sql
EXEC sp_droprolemember 'Sales', 'Jonb';
```

## Examples: [!INCLUDE [ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)]

The following example removes the user `JonB` from the role `Sales`.

```sql
EXEC sp_droprolemember 'Sales', 'JonB'
```
