## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sp_helppullsubscription
    [ [ @publisher = ] N'publisher' ]
    [ , [ @publisher_db = ] N'publisher_db' ]
    [ , [ @publication = ] N'publication' ]
    [ , [ @show_push = ] N'show_push' ]
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @publisher = ] N'*publisher*'

The name of the remote server. *@publisher* is **sysname**, with a default of `%`, which returns information for all Publishers.

#### [ @publisher_db = ] N'*publisher_db*'

The name of the Publisher database. *@publisher_db* is **sysname**, with a default of `%`, which returns all the Publisher databases.

#### [ @publication = ] N'*publication*'

The name of the publication. *@publication* is **sysname**, with a default of `%`, which returns all the publications. If this parameter equals to ALL, only pull subscriptions with independent_agent = `0` are returned.

#### [ @show_push = ] N'*show_push*'

Specifies whether all push subscriptions are to be returned. *@show_push* is **nvarchar(5)**, with a default of `false`, which doesn't return push subscriptions.
