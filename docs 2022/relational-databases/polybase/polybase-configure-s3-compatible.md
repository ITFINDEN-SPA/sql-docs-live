# Configure PolyBase to access external data in S3-compatible object storage

 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2022](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2022.md)]

This article explains how to use PolyBase to query external data in S3-compatible object storage.

[!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] introduces the ability to connect to any S3-compatible object storage, there are two available options for authentication: basic authentication or pass-through authorization (also known as STS authorization).

Basic Authentication, also known as static credentials, requires the user to store the `access key id` and `secret key id` in SQL Server, it is up to the user to explicitly revoke and rotate the credentials whenever needed. Fine-grained access control would require the administrator to set up static credentials for each login, this approach can be challenging when dealing with dozens or hundreds of unique credentials.

Pass-through (STS) authorization offers a solution for these problems by enabling the use of SQL Server own user's identities to access the S3-compatible object storage. S3-compatible object storage has the ability of assigning a temporary credential by using the Secure Token Service (STS). These credentials are short termed and dynamically generated.

This article includes instructions for both Basic Authentication and pass-through authorization (STS) authorization.

## Prerequisites

To use the S3-compatible object storage integration features, you need the following tools and resources:

- [Install the PolyBase feature for SQL Server](polybase-installation.md).
- Install [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](../../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md) or [Azure Data Studio](../../azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio.md).
- S3-compatible storage.
- An S3 bucket created. Buckets cannot be created or configured from SQL Server.
- A user (`Access Key ID`) and the secret (`Secret Key ID`) known to you. You need both to authenticate against the S3 object storage endpoint.
- Transport Layer Security (TLS) must be configured. It is assumed that all connections will be securely transmitted over HTTPS not HTTP. The endpoint will be validated by a certificate installed on the SQL Server OS Host. For more information on TLS and certificates, see [Enable encrypted connections to the Database Engine](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-sql-server-encryption.md).

## Permissions

In order for the proxy user to read the content of an S3 bucket, the user (`Access Key ID`) needs to be allowed to perform the following actions against the S3 endpoint:

- **GetBucketLocation** and **GetObject** permissions are needed to read a specific file from S3 object storage.
   - **ListBucket** is required for external tables or OPENROWSET queries that point to an S3 folder location, instead of a single file. Without **ListBucket** permissions, you will receive the error `Msg 4860, Level 16, State 7, Line 15 Cannot bulk load. The file "s3://<ip address>:9000/bucket/*.*" does not exist or you don't have file access rights.`
- **PutObject** permission is needed to write to S3 object storage.

> [!TIP]
> Your S3-compliant object storage provider might require additional API operation permissions, or use different naming for roles containing permissions to API operations. Consult your product documentation.

### Enable PolyBase

1. Enable PolyBase in `sp_configure`:

    ```sql
    EXEC sp_configure @configname = 'polybase enabled', @configvalue = 1;
    GO
    RECONFIGURE
    GO
    ```

1. Confirm the setting:

    ```sql
    EXEC sp_configure @configname = 'polybase enabled';
    ```

## Authentication

To continue, choose [Basic Authentication](#basic-authentication) or [pass-through (STS) authorization](#pass-through-sts-authorization).

### Basic Authentication

Before you create a database scoped credential, the user database must have a master key to protect the credential. For more information, see [CREATE MASTER KEY](../../t-sql/statements/create-master-key-transact-sql.md).

#### Create a database scoped credential with Basic Authentication

The following sample script creates a database scoped credential `s3-dc` in the `database_name` database in a SQL Server instance. For more information, see [CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/statements/create-database-scoped-credential-transact-sql.md).

```sql
USE [database_name];
GO
IF NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM sys.database_scoped_credentials WHERE name = 's3_dc')
BEGIN
 CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL s3_dc
 WITH IDENTITY = 'S3 Access Key',
 SECRET = '<AccessKeyID>:<SecretKeyID>' ;
END
GO
```

Verify the new database-scoped credential with [sys.database_scoped_credentials (Transact-SQL)](../system-catalog-views/sys-database-scoped-credentials-transact-sql.md):

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.database_scoped_credentials;
```

#### Create an external data source with Basic Authentication

The following sample script creates an external data source `s3_ds` in the source user database in SQL Server. The external data source references the `s3_dc` database scoped credential. For more information, see [CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE](../../t-sql/statements/create-external-data-source-transact-sql.md).

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE s3_ds
WITH
(   LOCATION = 's3://<ip_address>:<port>/'
,   CREDENTIAL = s3_dc
);
GO
```

Verify the new external data source with [sys.external_data_sources](../system-catalog-views/sys-external-data-sources-transact-sql.md).

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.external_data_sources;
```

#### Virtual hosted URLs

Some S3-compatible storage systems (such as Amazon Web Services) utilize `virtual_hosted` style URLs to implement folder structure in the S3 bucket. Add the following `CONNECTION_OPTIONS` to allow for creation of external tables pointing to folder locations in the S3 bucket, for example `CONNECTION_OPTIONS = '{"s3":{"url_style":"virtual_hosted"}}'`.

Without that `CONNECTION_OPTIONS` setting, when querying external tables pointing to a folder, you might observe the following error:

```output
Msg 13807, Level 16, State 1, Line 23  
Content of directory on path '/<folder_name>/' cannot be listed. 
```

#### Limitations of Basic Authentication

- For S3-compatible object storage, customers are not allowed to create their access key ID with a `:` character in it.
- The total URL length is limited to 259 characters. This means `s3://<hostname>/<objectkey>` shouldn't exceed 259 characters. The `s3://` counts toward this limit, so the path length cannot exceed 259-5 = 254 characters.
- The SQL credential name is limited by 128 characters in UTF-16 format.
- The credential name created must contain the bucket name unless this credential is for a new external data source.
- Access Key ID and Secret Key ID must only contain alphanumeric values.

### Pass-through (STS) authorization

S3-compatible object storage has the ability to assign a temporary credential by using Secure Token Service (STS). These credentials are short termed and dynamically generated.

Pass-through authorization relies on Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS) acting as OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider, it is up to the ADFS to communicate with the S3-compatible object storage STS, request the STS and provide it back to SQL Server.

#### Use pass-through (STS) authorization on SQL Server

1. TLS must be configured with certificates between the SQL Server and the S3-compatible host server. It is assumed that all connections will be securely transmitted over HTTPS, not HTTP. The endpoint will be validated by a certificate installed on the SQL Server OS Host. Public or self-signed certificates are supported.

1. Create a database scoped credential to which will be used to pass the identity to the S3-compatible object storage. For more information, see [CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/statements/create-database-scoped-credential-transact-sql.md). As the following example:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL CredName
    WITH IDENTITY = 'User Identity'
    ```

1. Create an external data source to access the S3-compatible object storage. Use `CONNECTION_OPTIONS`, as JSON format, to inform the required information for both the ADFS and STS. For more information, see [CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE](../../t-sql/statements/create-external-data-source-transact-sql.md). As the following example:

    ```syntaxsql
    CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE EdsName
    WITH
    {
        LOCATION = 's3://<hostname>:<port>/<bucket_name>'
        , CREDENTIAL = <CredName>
        [ , CONNECTION_OPTIONS = ' {
            [ , "authorization": {
                    "adfs": {
                        "endpoint": "http[s]://hostname:port/servicepath",
                        "relying_party": "SQL Server Relying Party Identifier"
                    },
                    "sts": {
                        "endpoint": "http[s]://hostname:port/stspath",
                        "role_arn": "Role Arn"
                        [ , "role_session_name": "AD user login" ] -- default value if not provided
                        [ , "duration_seconds": 3600 ]             -- default value if not provided
                        [ , "version": "2011-06-15" ]              -- default value if not provided
                        [ , "request_parameters": "In request query string format" ]
                    }
                } ]
            [ , "s3": {
                "url_style": "Path"
                } ]
        }' ]
    }
    ```

- `ADFS` options specify Windows transport endpoint and `relying_party` identifier of SQL Server in ADFS.
- `STS` options specify S3-compatible object storage STS endpoint and parameters for `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` request. The `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` is the method used to acquire the temporary security credential used to authenticate. For the complete list of parameters, including optional ones, and information about default values, refer to [STS API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html).

#### Use pass-through (STS) authorization with Active Directory

- Mark SQL Server user accounts properties in AD as nonsensitive to allow pass-through to S3-compatible storage.
- Allow Kerberos constrained delegation to ADFS services for the user related to [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] SPN (Service Principal Names).

#### Use pass-through (STS) authorization with Active Directory Federation Service

- Enable the SQL Server to be a [claims provider trust](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/create-a-claims-provider-trust) in Active Directory.
- Allow intranet windows authentication as authentication methods for ADFS.
- Enable windows transport service endpoint in your intranet.
- Enable OIDC (OpenID Connect) endpoints.
- Register SQL Server as a [relying party trust](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/create-a-relying-party-trust).
    * Provide a unique identifier.
    * Set claims rules for JWT (JSON Web Token).
<!--    * Sub – SQL Server login name.-->
- Custom claims - These claims can be added by customers if these are needed to determine access policy on the storage side.
- For more vendor-specific information, check with your S3-compatible platform provider.

#### Use pass-through (STS) authorization on S3-compatible object storage

- Follow documentation provided by S3-compatible storage provider to set up external OIDC identity provider. To set up identity provider mostly following values are commonly needed.

    * Configuration endpoint of OIDC provider.
    * Thumbprint of OIDC provider.
    * Pass-through authorization to S3-compatible object storage

#### Limitations of pass-through (STS) authorization

- Pass-through authorization (STS) to S3-compatible object storage is supported for SQL Server logins with Windows authentication.
- STS tokens cannot be used for [BACKUP to URL for S3-compatible object storage](../backup-restore/sql-server-backup-to-url-s3-compatible-object-storage.md).
- ADFS and SQL Server must be in the same domain. ADFS Windows transport endpoint should be disabled from the extranet.
- ADFS should have the same AD (Active directory) as SQL Server as claim trust provider.
- S3-compatible storage should have STS endpoint service that enables clients to request temporary credentials using JWT of external identities.
- OPENROWSET and CETAS (Create External Table as Select) queries are supported for parquet and CSV format.
- By default, Kerberos ticket renewal time is seven days and lifetime are 10 hours on Windows and 2 hours on Linux. SQL Server renews Kerberos token of the user up to seven days. After seven days the user's ticket expires, therefore pass-through to S3-compatible storage will fail. In this case, SQL Server must reauthenticate the user to get a new Kerberos ticket.
- ADFS 2019 with Windows Server 2019 is supported.
- S3 REST API calls use AWS signature version 4.
<!-- * Supported STS version will be 2011-06-15.-->

## PolyBase on SQL Server on Linux

For PolyBase on SQL Server on Linux, more configuration is needed.

- TLS must be configured. It is assumed that all connections will be securely transmitted over HTTPS not HTTP. The endpoint is validated by a certificate installed on the SQL Server OS Host.
- Certificate management is different on Linux. Review and follow the configuration detailed in [Linux support for S3-compatible storage](../backup-restore/sql-server-backup-to-url-s3-compatible-object-storage.md#linux-support).
