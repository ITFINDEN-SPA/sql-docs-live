# Asymmetric keys encryption strength

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

This rule checks whether asymmetric keys were created by using 1024-bit or stronger encryption.

## Best practices recommendations

Use RSA 1024-bit or stronger encryption to create asymmetric keys for data encryption.
